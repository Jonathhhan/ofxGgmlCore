# Core Contract

This document is the working contract for the `main` rewrite of `ofxGgml`.
It should be updated before large implementation changes, not after the addon
has drifted.

## Purpose

`ofxGgml` core is the narrow foundation for openFrameworks projects that need
local ggml compute. It owns ggml runtime setup, graph execution, model metadata,
and a small C++ API that can be depended on by optional layers.

The core is not a product workflow framework. The frozen `legacy-full` branch is
the archive of the previous broad experiment and should be mined for useful
code, tests, and build lessons.

## Non-Goals

These are not allowed in core by default:

- chat/coding assistants
- RAG, web crawling, citation search, project memory, or workflow manifests
- TTS, vision, diffusion, YOLO, CLIP, SAM, or SAM3 adapters
- speech recognition, transcription, or voice workflows; use `ofxGgmlSpeech`
- video essay, montage, MilkDrop, Holoscan, or GUI workflow experiments
- music, audio analysis, or generation workflows; use `ofxGgmlMusic`
- model downloads or large generated binaries committed to the repository

Those features can become companion addons or optional layers that depend on
core. The first named companion lanes are `ofxGgmlSam` for SAM/SAM3 work,
`ofxGgmlMusic` for music/audio workflows, and `ofxGgmlSpeech` for speech and
voice workflows. See `docs/COMPANIONS.md` for the split rule before adding any
domain workflow to core.

## Public Surface

The core public surface is:

- `ofxGgmlResult<T>` and `ofxGgmlError`
- `ofxGgmlRuntime`, `ofxGgmlRuntimeSettings`, and `ofxGgmlComputeResult`
- `ofxGgmlBackend` and `ofxGgmlGetBackendName()`
- `ofxGgmlTensor`
- `ofxGgmlGraph`
- `ofxGgmlModel` and `ofxGgmlModelInfo`
- `ofxGgmlTextGenerator` and text request/result types
- `ofxGgmlLlamaCliTextBackend` and `ofxGgmlLlamaServerTextBackend`
- `ofxGgmlEmbeddingGenerator`, embedding request/result types, and vector helpers
- `ofxGgmlSegmentationInference` and segmentation request/result types
- `ofxGgmlSam3.h` and SAM3 adapter hooks as an optional layer
- `ofxGgmlCore.h`
- `ofxGgmlText.h`
- `ofxGgmlEmbedding.h`
- `ofxGgmlSegmentation.h`
- `ofxGgmlSam3.h`
- `ofxGgml.h`

`ofxGgml.h` should remain a boring umbrella. Text belongs there only as a small
backend-neutral API. Embeddings belong there only as a small request/result API
and math helpers. Segmentation belongs there only as a small prompt/result API;
SAM3 remains an optional adapter exposed through `ofxGgmlSam3.h`. Concrete
llama.cpp CLI/server adapters must keep process execution or HTTP transport
behind a replaceable boundary, provide a default runner only when it is small
and testable, and carry focused tests.

Getter-style public methods should follow openFrameworks naming where it is
clearer for addon users. Public backend labels use `getBackendName()` on runtime
and adapter instances, and `ofxGgmlGetBackendName()` for enum labels. Runtime
state and device snapshots are exposed as `getState()` and `getDevices()`.
Low-level tensor and graph escape hatches are explicit getters such as
`getRaw()`, `getContext()`, and `getNodeCount()`.

## Runtime Contract

`ofxGgmlRuntime` owns backend resources. It must:

- be movable but not copyable
- release all backend resources in `close()` and the destructor
- make `setup()` idempotent by closing previous state first
- default to `Auto`, trying built GPU backends before CPU fallback
- report backend setup failures through `ofxGgmlResult<void>`
- expose state, backend label, and device snapshots through getter-style
  methods
- avoid process aborts where recovery is practical
- keep async execution out of the first stable core release

CPU support is required. GPU support is optional and must be detected or
explicitly requested by setup scripts.

## Tensor And Graph Contract

`ofxGgmlTensor` is a lightweight handle. It does not own storage.

`ofxGgmlGraph` owns the ggml context used to create graph tensors. It must:

- be movable but not copyable
- keep tensor handles valid only while the graph exists
- reject invalid dimensions before calling ggml where possible
- require an explicit `build()` before allocation or compute
- keep operation names small and conventional: `add`, `mul`, `matmul`, etc.

Data upload and download belong on `ofxGgmlRuntime`, because backend memory is a
runtime concern.

## Model Contract

`ofxGgmlModel` starts as metadata inspection only. Loading model weights into
backend buffers is a later milestone.

The first supported format is GGUF metadata via gguf headers. Missing gguf
support should produce a clear error, not a compile failure for projects that
have not run dependency setup.

## Dependency Contract

Core dependency setup must be reproducible:

- pin ggml to `v0.11.0` before the `1.0.1` release
- populate `libs/ggml/include`
- populate `libs/ggml/lib`
- do not commit generated ggml binaries by default
- support CPU by default
- keep CUDA, Vulkan, Metal, and OpenCL as explicit setup options
- use auto-detection by default when no backend switch is supplied
- fail before CMake when an explicitly requested backend SDK is unavailable
- provide Windows batch and POSIX shell wrappers for setup
- run Windows CMake builds through Visual Studio's native compiler environment

The setup script should be safe to rerun and should not delete files outside the
addon.

## Testing Contract

Every public type needs a focused test before it is treated as stable.

Minimum test categories:

- result/error behavior
- public header compilation
- standalone public umbrella header compilation
- graph lifecycle
- tensor shape and byte-size reporting
- runtime setup failure when ggml is absent
- runtime setup/compute when ggml is present
- model metadata failure and success paths

The headless test target should compile without openFrameworks. openFrameworks
examples are smoke checks, not the only tests.

## Example Contract

Each example should demonstrate one idea:

- `ofxGgmlSimpleExample`: runtime setup and one tiny graph
- `ofxGgmlTextExample`: one editable local text-generation prompt
- `ofxGgmlChatExample`: interactive chat against a warm server, with CLI fallback
- `ofxGgmlEmbeddingExample`: compare two texts through an embedding server

Segmentation remains script-tested through `scripts/test-sam3-smoke.*` until
the example gate in `docs/SEGMENTATION.md` is met.

No all-in-one GUI example belongs in core.

## Expansion Gate

A feature may enter core only if all are true:

- it is needed by most downstream companion layers
- it has a small public API
- it has a focused test
- it has a focused example or documented smoke check
- it does not require large committed binaries
- it does not add workflow/product assumptions

If any answer is no, the feature belongs in a companion addon or an optional
layer.

    repository is clean.
