## Effort Estimate

- **Preparation**: 6-8 hours (scripts, examples, setup)
- **Recording**: 8-12 hours (multiple takes, different platforms)
- **Editing**: 12-16 hours (4 videos × 3-4 hours each)
- **Publishing**: 2-3 hours (upload, descriptions, SEO)
- **Total**: 28-39 hours

## Alternative: Community Contribution

If creating official tutorials is too time-intensive, consider:

1. **Written tutorials**: Convert scripts to blog posts (faster to create)
2. **Community videos**: Encourage users to create tutorials (link to best ones)
3. **Live streams**: Record coding sessions (less editing required)
4. **Short clips**: Create 2-3 minute feature highlights instead of full tutorials
