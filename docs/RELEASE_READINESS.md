# Release Readiness

This document is the pre-tag checklist for the rewritten `main` line. It defines
what belongs in `1.0.1` and what must stay optional.

## 1.0.1 Scope

`1.0.1` should promise a narrow, dependable addon:

- ggml setup pinned to `v0.11.0`
- `ofxGgmlCore.h` for runtime, tensors, graphs, GGUF metadata, and results
- `ofxGgmlText.h` for backend-neutral text requests and llama.cpp adapters
- `ofxGgmlEmbedding.h` for embedding requests, server adapter, and vector helpers
- `ofxGgmlSegmentation.h` for point-prompt segmentation and optional SAM3 hooks
- focused openFrameworks examples for core, text, chat, and embeddings
- script-tested segmentation/SAM3 boundary
- Windows batch and PowerShell scripts, with POSIX shell wrappers where practical

`1.0.1` should not promise assistants, RAG, speech, TTS, diffusion, broad
vision workflows, model downloads, or product-level GUI workflows.

## Required Checks

Run the fast local validation command before tagging:

```bat
scripts\validate-local.bat
```

That command must pass and must not open UI windows or start long-running
servers. It covers:

- headless C++ addon tests
- setup dry-run smoke checks
- generated Visual Studio project repair checks
- launch dry-run smoke checks
- generated-artifact hygiene checks

When validating optional local runtimes, also run the relevant smoke scripts:

```bat
scripts\test-backend-setup-dry-run.bat -Cuda
scripts\test-backend-setup-dry-run.bat -Vulkan
scripts\test-backend-setup-dry-run.bat -CudaVulkan
scripts\test-sam3-smoke.bat
scripts\test-sam3-smoke.bat -ModelPath C:\path\to\sam3-model.gguf
scripts\run-embedding.bat -Prompt "openFrameworks local inference"
```

Example builds are useful release confidence checks when generated project files
exist locally:

```bat
scripts\build-simple-example.bat
scripts\build-text-example.bat
scripts\build-chat-example.bat
scripts\build-embedding-example.bat
```

## Current Local Confidence

Last checked on 2026-05-10 on Windows x64 with Visual Studio 18:

- `scripts\validate-local.ps1` passed.
- `scripts\test-setup-dry-run.ps1` passed as part of local validation, including
  default, CPU-only, and invalid-option dry-run checks.
- `scripts\test-launch-dry-run.ps1` passed as part of local validation,
  including server-mode, explicit CLI fallback, and standalone
  `llama-embedding` runner dry-runs.
- `scripts\test-artifact-hygiene.ps1` passed as part of local validation.
- `scripts\test-backend-setup-dry-run.ps1 -Cuda -Vulkan -CudaVulkan` passed
  setup-plan checks on a machine with CUDA and Vulkan SDKs installed.
- `scripts\build-simple-example.ps1 -Configuration Release -Platform x64`
  passed after a transient openFrameworks tlog lock retry; 0 warnings, 0
  errors.
- `scripts\build-text-example.ps1 -Configuration Release -Platform x64`
  passed after closing a running `ofxGgmlTextExample.exe`; 0 warnings, 0
  errors.
- `scripts\build-chat-example.ps1 -Configuration Release -Platform x64`
  passed; 23 warnings, 0 errors.
- `scripts\build-embedding-example.ps1 -Configuration Release -Platform x64`
  passed; 23 warnings, 0 errors.
- README commands for setup, validation, llama-server, embedding, and SAM3 smoke
  were checked against the script parameters.
- Generated project files, binaries, build caches, local dependency builds, and
  model artifacts were checked against `.gitignore` by
  `scripts\test-artifact-hygiene.ps1`.

The remaining warnings are from openFrameworks/ofxImGui headers and generated
Visual Studio project integration, not addon compile errors.

## Tag Gate

Before creating the `1.0.1` tag:

- `main` is clean after validation.
- README setup and validation commands match the actual scripts.
- `docs/CORE_CONTRACT.md` has no stale "Next" item that should have been done.
- generated binaries, model files, caches, and project files are not staged.
- optional runtimes fail clearly when not installed.
- any new public type has a focused headless test.
- any new example has a build script and a dry-run or repair smoke path.

## Gap Review

These items are intentionally not blockers for `1.0.1`:

- Real SAM3 model/image UX: deferred until a known-compatible model and sample
  image workflow are available. See `docs/SEGMENTATION.md`.
- Model downloads: deferred. The addon should document paths and environment
  variables, not ship or download large model files by default.
- Full example builds in `validate-local`: deferred. `validate-local` stays
  fast and non-interactive; full openFrameworks example builds remain explicit
  confidence checks.
- All-backend build verification: deferred from the core tag gate. CPU is the
  required baseline; CUDA, Vulkan, Metal, and OpenCL are validated through
  explicit setup dry-runs and setup switches on machines that have the relevant
  SDKs.
- POSIX generated project builds: deferred. Shell wrappers are included, but
  platform projects still depend on local openFrameworks project generation.
- Exact release version string: closed for `1.0.1`.

These items should be closed before `1.0.1`:

- No open pre-tag hygiene items remain in this document. If new public API or
  scripts are added, rerun this checklist before tagging.

## Versioning

After `1.0.1`, breaking changes should be called out in release notes and should
move the version intentionally.

`legacy-full` remains the archive branch for the previous broad implementation.
