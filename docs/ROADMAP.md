# ofxGgml Strategic Roadmap

This document tracks the Option A direction for ofxGgml: a boring, dependable openFrameworks addon for ggml tensors plus basic local LLM inference. Larger creative-application workflows belong in companion addons or example-level integrations so every user does not pay for every experiment.

**Last Updated**: 2026-05-05
**Current Version**: 1.0.4

---

## North Star

ofxGgml should be the easiest way to add **ggml tensors and basic local LLM inference** to openFrameworks projects.

The core addon should be predictable infrastructure. The broader creative AI framework can stay ambitious, but it should live in companion projects that opt into ofxGgml rather than inside the default addon boundary.

That means prioritizing:

- **Stable tensor/model/text APIs** over application-framework scope creep
- **Small opt-in layers** over implicit all-in-one headers
- **Inspectable local inference** over opaque cloud orchestration
- **Examples and companion addons** over monolithic creative workflow growth
- **Clear feature boundaries** over accumulating unrelated media pipelines

---

## Guiding Product Principles

1. **Boring core, exciting elsewhere**
   The default addon should favor stable setup, clear diagnostics, and small APIs. Experimental creative systems should be built as companion addons or focused examples.

2. **Local by default**
   Core inference should run with local models, local tools, and local files whenever possible.

3. **Verifiable by design**
   Inference, retrieval, and helper features should expose provenance, warnings, confidence, and reproducibility metadata where relevant.

4. **Composable across modalities**
   Tensor, model, text, and optional modality helpers should connect through stable contracts without making the addon an application framework.

5. **Useful for artists and developers**
   APIs should work for creative coding apps without forcing the addon to own their application lifecycle.

6. **Reference examples, not monoliths**
   The GUI example should demonstrate addon APIs. Video essay, montage, music/AceStep, MilkDrop, and Holoscan workflows should move to companion addons or remain example-level integrations.

---

## Delivery Phases

## Phase 1: Quick Wins (0-3 Months)

**Status**: ✅ **5 of 5 features complete** (100% complete)

Focus: remove adoption friction and improve day-to-day usability.

### Quick Summary

Phase 1 focused on high-impact improvements to developer experience and operational visibility:

- ✅ **Model Onboarding** - Complete with verified checksums, provenance tracking, catalog v2
- ✅ **Health Monitoring** - Complete with memory usage, server queue status, diagnostics reports
- ✅ **Semantic Cache** - Complete with CLIP embeddings, LRU eviction, hit rate tracking
- ✅ **Hybrid Retrieval** - Complete with keyword+semantic+quality scoring, reranking
- ✅ **Example Cleanup** - Phase 1A complete: GUI example refactored to core APIs only

All Phase 1 features are now production-ready and available in the current release. The GUI example has been successfully refactored to focus exclusively on core addon APIs.

---

### 1. Model Onboarding and Compatibility
**Priority**: HIGH
**Status**: ✅ Complete

Build a first-class model onboarding flow that combines:

- direct model download helpers
- integrity verification and provenance checks
- compatibility hints for modality/backend requirements

- Thread-safe implementation with mutex protection
- Model and settings isolation (cache hits only for matching model+settings)
- Memory usage tracking and statistics reporting

**Outcome**: faster iteration for creative prompting, review loops, and research-heavy tasks with 30-50% reduction in redundant LLM calls.

### 4. Hybrid Retrieval
**Priority**: HIGH
**Status**: ✅ Complete

Upgrade retrieval workflows with hybrid keyword + embedding ranking and optional reranking.

Implemented features:

- `ofxGgmlRAGPipeline` with hybrid retrieval support

**Outcome**: better grounding quality for citation search, RAG, and research-driven assistants with improved relevance and diversity.

### 5. Roadmap-Aligned Example Cleanup
**Priority**: MEDIUM
**Status**: ✅ Phase 1A Complete

Reduce the giant GUI example to a showcase for API layers and UI patterns. Complex workflows should move into focused examples, tutorial projects, or companion addons instead of using the GUI example as a test harness.

**Phase 1A Completed** (2026-05-05):
- ✅ Removed 5 companion workflow source files (4,283 lines)
- ✅ Cleaned ofApp.h: 1,271 → 772 lines (39% reduction)
- ✅ Cleaned ofApp.cpp: 8,175 → 7,524 lines (8% reduction)
- ✅ Reduced AiMode enum from 16 to 10 modes
- ✅ Removed companion workflow addons (ofxProjectM, ofxStableDiffusion)
- ✅ Total reduction: 31,650 → 23,589 lines (25% reduction)

**Core modes preserved** (10):
- Chat, Script, Summarize, Write, Translate, Custom (text modes)
- Vision, Speech, TTS (modalities)
- Easy (convenience API)

**Companion workflows removed** (6):
- VideoEssay, LongVideo (multi-stage workflows)
- Diffusion, Clip, MilkDrop, Sam (advanced vision/generation)

**Next steps** (Phase 1B/1C):
- Extract 4 focused companion examples from removed code
- Create migration documentation
- Update main README

**Outcome**: GUI example now demonstrates stable addon tier APIs exclusively. Code reduced by 25% with clear separation between core and companion features.

---

## Phase 2: Companion Handoff Contracts (3-6 Months)

Focus: define small, stable contracts that let companion projects compose workflows without turning ofxGgml into the workflow application.

### 1. Workflow Handoff Contracts
**Priority**: HIGH  
**Status**: 🔄 In Progress

Standardize lightweight handoff contracts so companion apps can connect stages like:

`crawl -> cite -> outline -> script -> TTS -> subtitles -> video plan`

Target capabilities:

- typed inputs and outputs
- shared input/output contracts
- resumable execution metadata
- inspectable intermediate outputs
- replay support for deterministic debugging

Implemented foundation:

- `ofxGgmlWorkflowManifest` shared schema primitive for inputs, artifacts, intermediate outputs, warnings, review notes, metadata, and downstream handoff notes
- JSON serialization for companion/example handoff files without coupling the core addon to a specific creative workflow runtime
- workflow-layer exposure through `ofxGgmlWorkflows.h`

### 2. Shared Workflow Manifest
**Priority**: HIGH  
**Status**: 🔄 In Progress

Standardize a manifest format that can carry:

- workflow-layer exposure through `ofxGgmlWorkflows.h`
- unit coverage for stable JSON keys that docs, launchers, or companion tooling can consume

**Outcome**: easier onboarding and less pressure on a single all-in-one showcase.

---

## Phase 3: Assistant Reliability and Companion Copilots (6-9 Months)

Focus: keep the core assistant surfaces safe and inspectable while letting companion projects explore coordinated creative systems.

### 1. Specialist Assistant Teams
**Priority**: HIGH  
**Status**: 🔄 In Progress

Evolve assistants toward explicit roles such as:

- researcher
- planner
- critic
- editor
- renderer

The key constraint is to preserve approval-first execution and workspace safety while improving delegation and handoff quality.

Implemented foundation:

- `ofxGgmlAssistantTeamSpec` shared schema primitive for specialist roles, role-to-role handoffs, approval requirements, workspace rules, and metadata
- default specialist team entry points for researcher, planner, critic, editor, and renderer roles
- schema version `ofxGgml.assistant_team.v1`
- assistant-layer exposure through `ofxGgmlAssistants.h`
- unit coverage for default roles, approval-first constraints, and stable JSON keys

### 2. Timeline-Aware Companion Copilots
**Priority**: HIGH  
**Status**: 🔄 In Progress

Explore assistant patterns tailored to media creation outside the default addon boundary:

- video essay planning

- workflow-layer exposure through `ofxGgmlWorkflows.h`
- unit coverage for default lanes, review checkpoints, stable JSON keys, and empty-entry handling

### 3. Continuity, Consistency, and Asset Reuse
**Priority**: MEDIUM-HIGH  
**Status**: 🔄 In Progress

Let companion systems build on core provenance and manifest support for:

- scene continuity across long-form video planning
- style consistency across generated prompts and outputs
- reusable asset references and project-level constraints

**Outcome**: better long-form coherence for multi-stage creative work.

Implemented foundation:

- `ofxGgmlContinuityAssetLedger` shared schema primitive for scene continuity rules, style constraints, reusable asset references, review notes, and manifest/project-memory handoffs
- default continuity rules for scene identity and timeline order
- default style constraints for palette reuse and generation guardrails
- default reusable asset references for approved hero references and motif prompts
- schema version `ofxGgml.continuity_asset_ledger.v1`
- workflow-layer exposure through `ofxGgmlWorkflows.h`
- unit coverage for default rules, reusable assets, stable JSON keys, and empty-entry handling

### 4. Trust and Evaluation Suites
**Priority**: MEDIUM-HIGH  
**Status**: 💡 Proposed

Build repeatable evaluation coverage for:

- citation quality
- workflow correctness
- latency and throughput
- multimodal coherence
- assistant safety and approval behavior

**Outcome**: “local and verifiable” becomes an enforceable product property, not just positioning.

---

## Phase 4: Ecosystem and Extensibility (9-12 Months)

Focus: let other developers build companion layers on top of the stable addon foundation.

### 1. Plugin System
**Priority**: HIGH  
**Status**: 💡 Proposed

Create a plugin architecture for:

- custom inference backends
- companion workflow nodes
- modalities and renderers
- search/retrieval providers
- tool adapters and assistant capabilities

### 2. Third-Party Integration Surface
**Priority**: MEDIUM-HIGH  
**Status**: 💡 Proposed

Encourage integrations with:

- editors and IDE-like shells
- external renderers and media tools
- search providers and research pipelines
- hardware/media runtimes

### 3. Personalization and Adaptation
**Priority**: MEDIUM  
**Status**: 💡 Proposed

Explore higher-level personalization features such as:

- LoRA adapter support
- reusable project presets
- stylistic profiles for media generation

### 4. Collaborative and Real-Time Workflows
**Priority**: MEDIUM  
**Status**: 💡 Proposed

After core local flows are stable, evaluate real-time and collaborative creative pipelines that build on the manifest, memory, and plugin foundations.

---

## Cross-Cutting Workstreams

These themes should shape every phase rather than live in only one release.

### Trust and Provenance
- keep source trails, warnings, and confidence visible
- preserve reproducibility metadata in workflow artifacts
- prefer inspectable structured outputs for handoff-heavy systems

### Stable Addon APIs
- move only stable, broadly useful logic out of example code and into reusable addon surfaces
- avoid locking roadmap features inside one GUI-specific implementation
- keep experimental creative orchestration in companion/example tiers

### Performance and Responsiveness
- prioritize caching, batching, backpressure, and resumable execution
- expose runtime signals that let hosts adapt to local hardware constraints

### Documentation and Learnability
- align README, roadmap, and focused examples around the same product story
- explain how stable addon features support host apps and companion systems without expanding the default core

---

## Suggested Priority Order

### First
- model onboarding
- health monitoring and runtime dashboards
- semantic cache
- hybrid retrieval

### Next
- workflow handoff contracts
- shared workflow manifests
- GUI modularization
- focused companion/example apps

### Then
- specialist multi-agent orchestration
- plugin ecosystem
- project memory across sessions
- evaluation suites

### Finally
- advanced creative copilots in companion projects
- personalization and LoRA-style adaptation
- collaborative and real-time creative pipelines

---

## What Success Looks Like

ofxGgml will have reached this roadmap’s goal when an openFrameworks developer can:

- install and validate the right local model stack quickly
- use stable tensor, model, text, and optional modality APIs without inheriting unrelated experiments
- opt into companion workflows only when a project needs them
- inspect where outputs came from and why decisions were made
- build safe assistant-driven tools with approval gates and replayable execution
- hand off manifests, memory, and plugins to multiple creative applications without making the core addon own those apps

At that point, ofxGgml is not a monolithic creative AI framework. It is the stable local inference foundation that makes those frameworks possible somewhere else.

## Consolidated roadmap archive

The sections below preserve information from superseded standalone documents that were folded into this canonical file.

### From `QUICK_WINS.md`

# Quick Wins: New Features

This document describes the four high-impact, low-effort "Quick Win" features added to ofxGgml.

## 1. Streaming API with Backpressure Control

**File**: `src/inference/ofxGgmlStreamingContext.h`

A thread-safe streaming context that enables pause/resume/cancel capabilities and backpressure signals for controlling generation speed.

### Features
- Pause/resume streaming generation
- Cancellation support
- Backpressure threshold for flow control
- Buffer tracking (buffered/consumed characters)
- Statistics (total chunks, dropped chunks)
- Timeout support for waiting

### Example Usage
```cpp
#include "ofxGgml.h"

auto ctx = std::make_shared<ofxGgmlStreamingContext>();
ctx->setBackpressureThreshold(1000); // Pause if buffered > 1000 chars

ofxGgmlInference inference;
inference.generate(modelPath, prompt, settings, [ctx](const std::string& chunk) {
    // Check backpressure
    if (ctx->shouldPause()) {
        ctx->waitForResume(5000); // Wait up to 5 seconds
    }

    // Check cancellation
    if (ctx->isCancelled()) {
        return false; // Stop generation
    }

    // Process chunk
    displayText(chunk);
    ctx->addConsumedChars(chunk.size());
    return true;
});

// From another thread/UI:
ctx->pause();   // Pause generation
ctx->resume();  // Resume generation
ctx->cancel();  // Cancel generation
```

## 2. Comprehensive Logging and Metrics

**Files**:
- `src/core/ofxGgmlLogger.h` - Configurable logging
- `src/core/ofxGgmlMetrics.h` - Performance metrics
- `src/core/ofxGgmlMetrics.cpp` - Metrics implementation

### Logger Features
- Multiple log levels (Trace, Debug, Info, Warn, Error, Critical)
- Console and file output
- Custom callbacks
- Timestamp support
- Thread-safe

### Metrics Features
- Tokens/second tracking
- Cache hit/miss rates
- Memory usage monitoring
- Custom counters and gauges
- Timing histograms
- Per-model statistics

### Example Usage
```cpp
#include "ofxGgml.h"

// Configure logger
auto& logger = ofxGgmlLogger::getInstance();
logger.setLevel(ofxGgmlLogger::Level::Debug);
logger.setFileOutput("ofxGgml.log");

logger.info("Inference", "Starting generation");
logger.debug("Model", "Loading model from: " + path);
logger.error("Runtime", "Failed to initialize: " + error);

// Track metrics
auto& metrics = ofxGgmlMetrics::getInstance();
metrics.recordInferenceStart("llama-7b");
// ... do inference ...
metrics.recordInferenceEnd("llama-7b", tokensGenerated, elapsedMs);

// Get performance summary
std::cout << metrics.getSummary() << std::endl;

// Get specific stats
auto stats = metrics.getInferenceStats("llama-7b");
double tps = metrics.getAverageTokensPerSecond("llama-7b");
double cacheHitRate = metrics.getCacheHitRate();
```

## 3. Model Version Management and Hot-Swapping

**File**: `src/model/ofxGgmlModelRegistry.h`

A registry for managing multiple model versions with metadata tracking and runtime switching without restart.

### Features
- Version tracking for models
- Rich metadata (architecture, quantization, parameters, etc.)
- Active version management
- Hot-swapping support
- Query by type, ID, or version
- Extensible custom fields

### Example Usage
```cpp
#include "ofxGgml.h"

auto& registry = ofxGgmlModelRegistry::getInstance();

// Register multiple versions
ofxGgmlModelMetadata v1;
v1.modelId = "llama-7b";
v1.version = "v1-q4";
v1.path = "models/llama-7b-q4.gguf";
v1.modelType = "llm";
v1.architecture = "llama";
v1.quantization = "Q4_0";
v1.parameterCount = 7000;
v1.contextSize = 4096;
registry.registerModel(v1);

ofxGgmlModelMetadata v2;
v2.modelId = "llama-7b";
v2.version = "v2-q5";
v2.path = "models/llama-7b-v2-q5.gguf";
v2.modelType = "llm";
v2.architecture = "llama";
v2.quantization = "Q5_1";
registry.registerModel(v2);

// Set active version (hot-swap)
registry.setActiveVersion("llama-7b", "v2-q5");

// Get active model path for inference
std::string modelPath = registry.getActiveModelPath("llama-7b");

// Query models
auto versions = registry.listVersions("llama-7b");
auto llmModels = registry.listModelsByType("llm");
auto metadata = registry.getActiveMetadata("llama-7b");
```

## 4. Prompt Template Library

**File**: `src/support/ofxGgmlPromptTemplates.h`

A comprehensive library of reusable prompt templates with variable substitution for common AI tasks.

### Features
- 30+ built-in templates
- Variable substitution with `{{variable}}` syntax
- Default values with `{{variable|default}}`
- Custom template registration
- Categories: text processing, Q&A, code, creative writing, business, analysis, chat, multimodal, RAG

### Built-in Templates
- Text: summarize, key_points, expand, rewrite, translate
- Code: explain_code, review_code, generate_code, debug_code, document_code
- Q&A: qa, qa_with_sources
- Creative: story, dialogue, poem
- Business: email, meeting_notes, action_items, executive_summary
- Analysis: sentiment, classify, extract_entities
- Chat: chat_system, chat_context
- Multimodal: image_caption, image_qa, ocr
- RAG: rag_simple, rag_with_citations
- Structured: json_response, structured_output

### Example Usage
```cpp
#include "ofxGgml.h"

auto& templates = ofxGgmlPromptTemplates::getInstance();

// Use built-in template
std::string prompt = templates.fill("summarize", {
    {"text", articleContent},
    {"max_length", "5 sentences"}
});

// Code review template
std::string codeReview = templates.fill("review_code", {
    {"language", "C++"},
    {"code", sourceCode}
});

// Q&A with sources
std::string qaPrompt = templates.fill("qa_with_sources", {
    {"sources", formattedSources},
    {"question", userQuestion}
});

// Register custom template
templates.registerTemplate("custom_analysis",
    "Analyze the following {{data_type}} focusing on {{aspect}}:\n\n{{content}}");

std::string customPrompt = templates.fill("custom_analysis", {
    {"data_type", "performance metrics"},
    {"content", metricsData},
    {"aspect", "bottlenecks"}
});

// Direct text substitution
std::string result = ofxGgmlPromptTemplates::fillText(
    "Translate {{text}} to {{language|English}}",
    {{"text", "Hola"}, {"language", "French"}}
);
```

## Integration Benefits

These four features work together to provide:

1. **Better Control**: Streaming API gives fine-grained control over generation
2. **Observability**: Logging and metrics provide visibility into performance
3. **Flexibility**: Model registry enables easy version management and A/B testing
4. **Productivity**: Template library reduces boilerplate and standardizes prompts

## Thread Safety

All four features are thread-safe and can be used concurrently:
- StreamingContext uses mutex + condition variables
- Logger uses mutex for output operations
- Metrics uses mutex for counter updates
- ModelRegistry uses mutex for registry operations
- PromptTemplates is read-only after initialization (thread-safe)

## Performance Impact

- **Minimal overhead**: Logging and metrics checks are fast (atomic loads)
- **No blocking**: Async operations use condition variables efficiently
- **Memory efficient**: Metrics use bounded buffers (max 1000 samples per timing)
- **Cache friendly**: Registry lookups are O(log n) with std::map

## Next Steps

See the main README.md for additional improvement ideas in the strategic roadmap.

### From `IMPROVEMENTS_ROADMAP.md`

# Improvements Roadmap for ofxGgml

This document tracks the implementation status of architectural improvements identified during deep code review.

## Priority Matrix

| Improvement | Priority | Difficulty | Impact | Status |
|------------|----------|------------|--------|--------|
| Model Checksums | HIGH | LOW | Security | 🟡 Ready to Complete |
| RAII Integration | MEDIUM | HIGH | Code Quality | 🔄 Prepared |
| Result<T> Error Handling | MEDIUM | MEDIUM | API Quality | 📋 Planned |
| GUI Refactoring | LOW | MEDIUM | Maintainability | 📋 Planned |

---

## 1. Model Checksum Completion 🟡

**Status**: Infrastructure complete, awaiting checksum values
**Priority**: HIGH
**Estimated Effort**: 2-4 hours
**Files Affected**: `scripts/model-catalog.json`

### Current State
- SHA256 checksum framework implemented
- Validation in download scripts functional
- All 6 model presets have empty `sha256` fields
- Script `scripts/dev/update-model-checksums.sh` ready to use

### Implementation Steps
1. Download or locate each model file locally:
   - Preset 1: Qwen2.5-1.5B Instruct (~1.0 GB)
   - Preset 2: Qwen2.5-Coder-1.5B Instruct (~1.0 GB)
   - Preset 3: Phi-3.5-mini Instruct (~2.4 GB)
   - Preset 4: Llama-3.2-1B Instruct (~0.9 GB)
   - Preset 5: TinyLlama-1.1B Chat (~0.6 GB)
   - Preset 6: Qwen2.5-Coder-7B Instruct (~4.7 GB)

2. Run update script for each:
   ```bash
   ./scripts/dev/update-model-checksums.sh --preset 1
   ./scripts/dev/update-model-checksums.sh --preset 2
   # ... or use --all to process all at once
   ./scripts/dev/update-model-checksums.sh --all
   ```

3. Verify checksums match official sources when possible

4. Commit updated `model-catalog.json`

### Security Impact
- ✅ Prevents supply chain attacks
- ✅ Detects corrupted downloads
- ✅ Ensures model integrity
- ✅ Builds user trust

### Testing
- Download script already validates checksums
- Empty checksums issue warnings but don't block downloads
- Invalid checksums cause download failures

---

## 2. RAII Guards Integration ✅

**Status**: ✅ **COMPLETED** in commit 672af0f (as of 2026-04-22)
**Files Modified**: `src/core/ofxGgmlCore.cpp`, `src/core/ofxGgmlResourceGuards.h`

### Completed Implementation
- ✅ RAII guard classes created in `src/core/ofxGgmlResourceGuards.h`:
  - `GgmlBackendGuard` - wraps `ggml_backend_t`
  - `GgmlBackendBufferGuard` - wraps `ggml_backend_buffer_t`
  - `GgmlBackendSchedGuard` - wraps `ggml_backend_sched_t`
- ✅ Guards follow modern C++ RAII patterns
- ✅ Non-copyable, movable
- ✅ Automatic cleanup in destructors
- ✅ **Fully integrated into `ofxGgml::Impl`** (lines 57-93 of ofxGgmlCore.cpp)
- ✅ All accessor usage updated to use `.get()` method
- ✅ Simplified `close()` method using explicit `reset()` calls (lines 670-697)

### Solution to Shared Backend Case
When main backend is CPU, the `cpuBackend` guard remains empty (nullptr), and only the `backend` guard owns the resource. The code uses inline helper logic:
```cpp
ggml_backend_t effectiveCpuBackend = m_impl->cpuBackend.get() ?
    m_impl->cpuBackend.get() : m_impl->backend.get();
```

### Actual Benefits Achieved
- Eliminated 30+ lines of manual cleanup code
- Prevents resource leaks on error paths
- Simplified exception safety
- Makes ownership semantics explicit
- All guards properly handle both CPU-only and GPU+CPU modes

---

## 3. Result<T> Error Handling Standardization 📋

**Status**: Planned, `Result<T>` already implemented but underused
**Priority**: MEDIUM
**Estimated Effort**: 12-16 hours
**Files Affected**: All public API headers and implementations

### Current State
The codebase uses three different error patterns:

1. **Bool returns** (most common):
   ```cpp
   bool setup(const ofxGgmlSettings & settings);
   bool allocGraph(ofxGgmlGraph & graph);
   ```
   **Problem**: No error details, caller must check logs

2. **Custom result structs**:
   ```cpp
   struct ofxGgmlComputeResult {
       bool success;
       std::string error;
       float elapsedMs;
   };
   ```
   **Problem**: Inconsistent struct layouts

3. **Result<T>** (defined in `src/core/ofxGgmlResult.h` but underused):
   ```cpp
   template<typename T> class Result {
       // Modern error handling with error codes and messages
   };
   ```
   **Problem**: Exists but not used in public APIs

### Phase 1: Add Ex Variants (Non-Breaking)
Add `Result<T>` variants alongside existing methods:

```cpp
// In ofxGgmlCore.h:
// Keep existing:
bool setup(const ofxGgmlSettings & settings);

// Add new:
Result<void> setupEx(const ofxGgmlSettings & settings);
Result<void> allocGraphEx(ofxGgmlGraph & graph);
Result<void> loadModelWeightsEx(ofxGgmlModel & model);
```

Implementation pattern:
```cpp
Result<void> ofxGgml::setupEx(const ofxGgmlSettings & settings) {
    if (!setup(settings)) {
        return ofxGgmlError{
            ofxGgmlErrorCode::BackendInitFailed,
            "Failed to initialize backend"
        };
    }
    return Result<void>::ok();
}
```

### Phase 2: Migrate Result Structs
Replace custom result structs with `Result<T>`:

```cpp
// Old:
struct ofxGgmlComputeResult {
    bool success;
    std::string error;
    float elapsedMs;
};

// New:
struct ofxGgmlComputeInfo {
    float elapsedMs;
    // Other timing/metadata
};
Result<ofxGgmlComputeInfo> computeGraphEx(ofxGgmlGraph & graph);
```

### Phase 3: Deprecation (Future Release)
- Mark old bool-returning methods as deprecated
- Update examples to use new methods
- Document migration path in CHANGELOG

### Benefits
- Consistent error handling across all APIs
- Rich error context (codes + messages)
- Composable error propagation
- Better debugging and logging
- Type-safe success/error states

---

## 4. GUI Example Refactoring 📋

**Status**: Planned
**Priority**: LOW
**Estimated Effort**: 16-20 hours
**Files Affected**: `ofxGgmlGuiExample/src/ofApp.{h,cpp}`

### Current State
- `ofApp.cpp`: 10,923 lines in a single file
- `ofApp.h`: 570 lines
- All UI panels implemented in one class
- Difficult to navigate and maintain

### Proposed Structure
Split into focused panel classes:

```
ofxGgmlGuiExample/src/
├── ofApp.h/cpp              # Main app (reduced to ~1000 lines)
├── panels/
│   ├── GuiChatPanel.h/cpp        # Chat interface
│   ├── GuiScriptPanel.h/cpp      # Script/code assistance
│   ├── GuiVisionPanel.h/cpp      # Vision/video analysis
│   ├── GuiSpeechPanel.h/cpp      # Speech/TTS workflows
│   ├── GuiDiffusionPanel.h/cpp   # Image generation
│   └── GuiSettingsPanel.h/cpp    # Settings management
└── utils/
    ├── GuiSessionState.h/cpp     # Session persistence
    └── GuiHelpers.h/cpp          # Shared UI utilities
```

### Implementation Strategy
1. Create panel base class with common interface
2. Extract each mode into its own panel class
3. Move shared state to session manager
4. Update ofApp to delegate to panels
5. Maintain backward compatibility for settings persistence

### Benefits
- Each file <1500 lines
- Clear responsibility separation
- Easier to understand and modify
- Parallel development on different panels
- Better code navigation in IDEs

### Testing Requirements
- Verify all modes still function
- Test session save/restore
- Check UI layout consistency
- Validate keyboard shortcuts
- Test mode switching

**Last Updated**: 2026-04-21

---

## Completed Features

### ✅ Enhanced Streaming Progress (v1.1.0)

**Implemented**: 2026-04-21
**Files Modified**:
- `src/inference/ofxGgmlStreamingContext.h` - Core implementation
- `README.md` - User documentation
- `CHANGELOG.md` - Release notes

**Architecture**:
- Added `ofxGgmlStreamingProgress` struct as value type for progress snapshots

- Progress calculations are thread-safe and lock-protected
- Backward compatible - no breaking changes to existing API

**Usage Pattern**:
```cpp
auto ctx = std::make_shared<ofxGgmlStreamingContext>();
ctx->setEstimatedTotal(settings.maxTokens);

inference.generate(model, prompt, settings, [ctx](const string& chunk) {
    ctx->addTokens(1);
    auto progress = ctx->getProgress(chunk);
    // Use progress.percentComplete, progress.tokensPerSecond, etc.

});
```

**Testing Status**: ⚠️ Needs unit tests
**GUI Example**: 📋 Needs demonstration

**Next Steps**:
1. Add unit tests in `tests/` directory
2. Update GUI example to show progress bar
3. Consider adding example to `ofxGgmlBasicExample` or `ofxGgmlNeuralExample`

---

## Implementation Guidelines

### General Principles

1. **Backward Compatibility**: Always add new APIs alongside existing ones
   - Example: `setupEx()` alongside `setup()`
   - Keep existing methods unchanged until major version bump

2. **Non-Breaking Changes**: Prefer additive changes
   - Add new struct fields at the end
   - Add new methods to classes
   - Use optional parameters with defaults

3. **Testing**: Every feature needs tests
   - Unit tests in `tests/` directory
   - Integration tests where appropriate
   - Benchmark tests for performance features

4. **Documentation**: Three levels required
   - Inline code comments (doxygen style)
   - README.md examples
   - CHANGELOG.md entry

### Code Style

Follow existing patterns in the codebase:
- Use `m_` prefix for member variables
- Use camelCase for methods and variables
- Use PascalCase for classes and structs
- Thread safety: Use `std::lock_guard<std::mutex>` for state protection

---

## Next Priority Features

### 1. Preset Workflow Helpers (4-6 hours)

**Goal**: Add common workflow shortcuts to `ofxGgmlEasy`

**Implementation Approach**:
```cpp
// In ofxGgmlEasy.h
struct WorkflowResult {
    bool success;
    string output;
    vector<string> intermediateResults;
    float totalElapsedMs;
};

// Add these methods to ofxGgmlEasy
WorkflowResult summarizeAndTranslate(
    const string& text,
    const string& targetLang,
    const string& sourceLang = "auto"
);

WorkflowResult transcribeAndSummarize(
    const string& audioPath,
    int maxSummaryWords = 100
);

WorkflowResult describeAndAnalyze(
    const string& imagePath,
    const string& analysisPrompt = "Analyze this image in detail"
);
```

**Files to Modify**:
- `src/support/ofxGgmlEasy.h` - Add method declarations
- `src/support/ofxGgmlEasy.cpp` - Implement workflow logic
- `README.md` - Add usage examples
- `CHANGELOG.md` - Document new feature

**Testing**:
- Add tests in `tests/ofxGgmlEasyTest.cpp`
- Test each workflow independently
- Test error handling (missing files, etc.)

---

### 2. Semantic Cache (14-18 hours)

**Goal**: Cache inference results by semantic similarity

**Design Decisions**:
- Where to place: `src/inference/ofxGgmlSemanticCache.h`
- Dependencies: Uses existing `ofxGgmlEmbeddingIndex`
- Storage: In-memory with optional disk persistence
- TTL: Time-based expiration (simple approach)

**Implementation Plan**:

1. **Create Core Class** (4 hours)
```cpp
class ofxGgmlSemanticCache {
public:
    struct CacheEntry {
        string prompt;
        string result;
        vector<float> embedding;
        uint64_t timestampMs;
        float ttlSeconds;
    };

    struct LookupResult {
        bool found;
        string cachedResult;
        float similarity;
        string originalPrompt;
    };

    void setInference(ofxGgmlInference* inf);
    void setEmbeddingModel(const string& modelPath);

    LookupResult lookup(
        const string& prompt,
        float similarityThreshold = 0.95f
    );

    void store(
        const string& prompt,
        const string& result,
        float ttlSeconds = 3600.0f
    );

    void clearExpired();
    void clear();

    size_t size() const;
    CacheStats getStats() const;

private:
    ofxGgmlInference* m_inference;
    string m_embeddingModel;
    vector<CacheEntry> m_entries;
    ofxGgmlEmbeddingIndex m_index;
};
```

2. **Add to ofxGgmlInference** (2 hours)
```cpp
// In ofxGgmlInference.h
void setSemanticCache(ofxGgmlSemanticCache* cache);

// Modify generate() to check cache first
```

3. **Testing** (4 hours)
- Test cache hits and misses
- Test similarity threshold
- Test TTL expiration
- Test thread safety

4. **Integration** (2 hours)
- Add to `ofxGgmlEasy`
- Update GUI example

5. **Documentation** (2 hours)
- README example
- CHANGELOG entry
- Inline documentation

**Challenges**:
- Embedding computation adds 20-50ms overhead
- Need to tune similarity threshold (0.95 may be too strict)
- Cache invalidation strategy (start simple with TTL only)

---

### 3. Result<T> Ex Variants (12-16 hours)

**Goal**: Add `Result<T>` error handling alongside existing bool returns

**Already Defined**: `src/core/ofxGgmlResult.h` exists

**Implementation Strategy**:

Phase 1: Add Ex variants (8 hours)
- `setupEx()` alongside `setup()`
- `allocGraphEx()` alongside `allocGraph()`
- `loadModelWeightsEx()` alongside `loadModelWeights()`
- `generateEx()` alongside `generate()` (already exists!)

Phase 2: Update one example (4 hours)
- Modify `ofxGgmlBasicExample` to use Ex variants
- Show error handling patterns

Phase 3: Documentation (2 hours)
- Migration guide in docs
- README examples
- CHANGELOG

**Template for Implementation**:
```cpp
// In ofxGgmlCore.h
Result<void> setupEx(const ofxGgmlSettings& settings) {
    if (!setup(settings)) {
        return ofxGgmlError{
            ofxGgmlErrorCode::BackendInitFailed,
            "Failed to initialize backend: " + getLastError()
        };
    }
    return Result<void>::ok();
}
```

---

## Long-Term Architecture Notes

### Multi-Agent Framework (v2.0.0)

**Design Considerations**:
- Start with simple sequential delegation
- Build task memory/context system first
- Add parallel execution in phase 2
- Learn from `ofxGgmlCodingAgent` patterns

**Minimal Viable Agent**:
```cpp
class ofxGgmlAgent {
    string role;
    string systemPrompt;

    virtual AgentResponse execute(const AgentTask& task) = 0;
    virtual bool canHandle(const AgentTask& task) const = 0;
};
```

### Plugin System (v2.0.0)

**Critical Design Decisions**:
- C API boundary for ABI stability
- Version negotiation protocol
- Sandbox/permissions model
- Resource management (who owns what?)

**Research First**:
- Study existing plugin systems (VST, LADSPA, etc.)
- Define minimal plugin interface
- Prototype with one backend adapter
- Document plugin development guide

---

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests
- Location: `tests/`
- Framework: Catch2 (already in use)
- Coverage goal: 80%+
- Run with: `./scripts/benchmark-addon.sh`

### Integration Tests
- Test cross-component workflows
- Test error paths
- Test resource cleanup

### Performance Tests
- Benchmark new features
- Track regression
- Document expected performance

---

- `embed()` / `embedBatch()` - semantic embeddings
- `countPromptTokens()` - context management

**Synergy Mechanism:** Single configuration point via `ofxGgmlEasy::syncTextBackends()` propagates settings to all consumers.

---

### 1.2 Embedding Infrastructure

**Component:** `ofxGgmlEmbeddingIndex` in `ofxGgmlInference`
**Use Cases:**
- **Code Review** - Semantic file ranking by query relevance
- **Citation Search** - RAG-style source chunk selection (top-16 most relevant)
- **General RAG** - Document retrieval for source-grounded generation

**Implementation:** Cosine similarity search over text embeddings

**Recent Improvement:** Citation search upgraded from top-8 to top-16 chunks for broader coverage (commit 905bf3d).

---

### 1.3 CLIP Embeddings

**Component:** `ofxGgmlClipInference`
**Modalities:** Text and image embeddings

**Existing Integration:**
- **Diffusion Reranking** - `ofxGgmlStableDiffusionAdapters` uses CLIP to score generated images against prompts

**Newly Implemented (commit 3374df3):**
- **Image Search Semantic Ranking** - `ofxGgmlImageSearch` now supports CLIP-based reranking via `useSemanticRanking` flag
  - Wikimedia keyword results reranked by semantic similarity
  - Automatic fallback if CLIP not configured
  - Opt-in for backward compatibility

**Future Opportunities:**
- Video planning scene validation
- Media prompt translation quality verification
- Vision task pre-filtering

---

### 1.4 Subtitle/Segment Infrastructure

**Component:** `ofxGgmlSpeechSegment`
**Format:** Timestamped text segments with start/end times

**Pipeline Flow:**
```
Speech Transcription → Segments → Montage Planning → Subtitle Tracks → Preview/Playback
```

**Integration Points:**
1. **Speech → Montage**: `ofxGgmlMontagePlanner::segmentsFromSpeechSegments()` converts formats
2. **Montage → Preview**: `ofxGgmlMontagePreviewBridge` exposes dual subtitle tracks:
   - Montage-timed (selected clips only)
   - Source-timed (original positions)
3. **Preview → Playback**: ofxVlc4 integration for live preview with subtitles

**Standardization:** SRT/VTT format universally supported across all components.

---

### 1.5 Source-Grounded Generation System

**Component:** `ofxGgmlPromptSource` + fetch/build utilities
**Location:** `src/inference/ofxGgmlInferenceSourceInternals.h`

**Capabilities:**
- `fetchUrlSources()` - Fetch and normalize web content
- `collectScriptSourceDocuments()` - Aggregate code repository files
- `buildPromptWithSources()` - Assemble citation-ready prompts

**Shared By:**
- Citation search (extracts quotes from fetched sources)
- Code assistants (repository context injection)
- Video essay workflow (grounds outlines in research sources)

**Data Structure:**
```cpp
struct ofxGgmlPromptSource {
    std::string label;
    std::string uri;
    std::string content;
    bool isWebSource;
    bool wasTruncated;
};
```

---

## 2. REALIZED END-TO-END PIPELINES

### 2.1 Video Essay Workflow ✅

**Component:** `ofxGgmlVideoEssayWorkflow`

**Complete Pipeline:**
```
Topic → Citation Search → Outline → Script → Voice Cues → SRT → Scene Plans
```

**Integrated Components:**
- `ofxGgmlCitationSearch` (m_citationSearch)
- `ofxGgmlTextAssistant` (m_textAssistant)
- `ofxGgmlVideoPlanner` (m_videoPlanner)

**Output:** Unified JSON manifest containing:
- Citations with source URLs
- Outline with `[Source N]` references
- Script derived from outline
- SRT subtitles from voice cues
- Scene plan JSON
- Edit plan JSON

**Coordination:** All phases reference previous outputs (outline uses citations, script uses outline, etc.).

---

### 2.2 Speech-to-Montage Pipeline ✅

**Flow:**
```
Audio → Whisper STT → Segments → Montage Scoring → Clip Selection → EDL Export
```

**Format Conversions:**
1. Whisper produces `ofxGgmlSpeechSegment[]`
2. Montage planner converts via `segmentsFromSpeechSegments()`
3. Scoring ranks segments against goal
4. Outputs CMX EDL + SRT/VTT exports

**Preview Integration:** `ofxGgmlMontagePreviewBridge` packages:
- Playlist clips (sequential playback order)
- Dual subtitle tracks
- Duration calculations
- Cue lookup by timestamp

---

### 2.3 Media Prompt Translation ✅

**Component:** `ofxGgmlMediaPromptGenerator`

**Bidirectional Cross-Modal Translation:**
1. **Music → Image**: Music description + lyrics → visual diffusion prompt
2. **Image → Music**: Scene description → music generation prompt

**Integration:**
- Uses `ofxGgmlInference` for LLM-based translation
- Outputs feed directly to:
  - Diffusion inference (visual prompts)
  - Music generator (music prompts)

**Use Case:** Music video workflow uses Music→Image to generate visuals synchronized to audio.

---

## 3. NEWLY IMPLEMENTED SYNERGIES

### 3.1 CLIP + Image Search (commit 3374df3) ✨

**Problem:** Image search used keyword-only Wikimedia results with no semantic understanding.

**Solution:** Added optional CLIP-based semantic reranking.

**Implementation:**
- New `useSemanticRanking` flag in `ofxGgmlImageSearchRequest`
- New `semanticScore` field in `ofxGgmlImageSearchItem`
- `setClipInference()` method to configure CLIP backend
- `searchWithSemanticRanking()` method ranks results by cosine similarity

**Benefits:**
- Results ranked by semantic relevance to query, not just keyword match
- Leverages existing CLIP infrastructure (was only used for diffusion)
- Backward compatible (opt-in flag)

**Usage:**
```cpp
ofxGgmlImageSearch imageSearch;
imageSearch.setClipInference(&clipInference);

ofxGgmlImageSearchRequest request;
request.prompt = "neon city at night";
request.useSemanticRanking = true;

auto result = imageSearch.search(request);
// Results sorted by semanticScore (high to low)
```

---

### 3.2 Enhanced Citation Search Coverage (commit 905bf3d) ✨

**Changes:**
- Increased RAG retrieval from top-8 to top-16 chunks
- Increased realtime source fetching from 4 to 12 minimum sources
- Enhanced prompt with explicit source attribution requirements
- Added source diversity prioritization instruction

**Impact:**
- 2x broader chunk coverage for citation extraction
- 3x more diverse sources in realtime mode
- Stronger enforcement of exact quotes with source indices

---

### 3.3 CLIP Scene Coherence Validation (2026-04-23) ✨

**Implementation:** `ofxGgmlVideoPlanner::validateSceneCoherence()`

**Problem:** Video planning generated multi-scene plans without verifying that scenes aligned with the overall vision.

**Solution:** Use CLIP text embeddings to validate scene coherence.

**How it works:**
1. Embed the overall scene description/prompt as reference
2. For each scene, embed its event prompt or title+summary
3. Compute cosine similarity between overall and scene embeddings
4. Warn about scenes with low coherence (<0.5 similarity)
5. Return average coherence score and per-scene warnings

**Usage:**
```cpp
auto planResult = videoPlanner.plan(modelPath, request, settings, inference);
if (planResult.success && clipInference) {
    auto coherence = ofxGgmlVideoPlanner::validateSceneCoherence(
        planResult.plan, &clipInference);
    if (coherence.success && coherence.averageScore < 0.6f) {
        // Warn user about low overall coherence
        for (const auto& warning : coherence.warnings) {
            ofLogWarning() << warning;
        }
    }
}
```

**Benefits:**
- Early detection of off-topic scenes before generation
- Quantitative coherence metrics for plan quality
- Leverages existing CLIP infrastructure

---

### 3.4 Vision-Based Diffusion Validation (2026-04-23) ✨

**Implementation:** `ofxGgmlDiffusionInference::validateWithVision()`

**Problem:** Diffusion generates images but doesn't verify they match the prompt.

**Solution:** Use vision inference to describe generated images, then compute semantic alignment.

**How it works:**
1. For each generated image, use vision model to create description
2. If text inference available, embed both original prompt and description
3. Compute cosine similarity for alignment score
4. Return per-image scores and descriptions

**Usage:**
```cpp
auto genResult = diffusion.generate(request);
if (genResult.success && visionInference && textInference) {
    auto validation = ofxGgmlDiffusionInference::validateWithVision(
        genResult, request.prompt, &visionInference,
        visionProfile, &textInference);

    for (const auto& [idx, score] : validation.imageScores) {
        if (score < 0.6f) {
            // This image poorly matches the prompt
            ofLogWarning() << "Image " << idx << " alignment: " << score;
        }
    }
}
```

**Benefits:**
- Automated quality checking for generated images
- Close the generate→analyze→verify loop
- Enable prompt refinement based on analysis

---

### 3.5 Video Analysis Hints for Planning (2026-04-23) ✨

**Implementation:** `ofxGgmlVideoPlanner::extractHintsFromVideoAnalysis()` + `enrichPlanningPromptWithHints()`

**Problem:** Video analysis produces insights (emotion, action, pacing) but scene planning doesn't use them.

**Solution:** Extract structured hints from video analysis and inject them into planning prompts.

**How it works:**
1. `extractHintsFromVideoAnalysis()` extracts:
   - Primary emotion/action with confidence
   - Secondary action labels
   - Suggested pacing (dynamic, slow, moderate)
   - Suggested tone (reflective, intense, balanced)
   - Timeline progression
2. `enrichPlanningPromptWithHints()` augments planning prompt with these hints
3. Planner uses hints to inform scene tone, pacing, and progression

**Usage:**
```cpp
// Analyze source video first
auto videoResult = videoInference.runTemporalSidecarRequest(videoRequest);
if (videoResult.success && !videoResult.structured.primaryLabel.empty()) {
    // Extract hints from analysis
    auto hints = ofxGgmlVideoPlanner::extractHintsFromVideoAnalysis(
        videoResult.structured);

    // Build base planning prompt
    std::string basePrompt = ofxGgmlVideoPlanner::buildPlanningPrompt(planRequest);

    // Enrich with analysis hints
    std::string enrichedPrompt =
        ofxGgmlVideoPlanner::enrichPlanningPromptWithHints(basePrompt, hints);

    // Use enriched prompt for planning (modifies request prompt)
}
```

**Benefits:**
- Context-aware planning based on actual video content
- Better pacing and tone decisions informed by analysis
- Connects analytical and generative pipelines

---

## 4. ARCHITECTURAL PATTERNS ENABLING SYNERGY

### 4.1 Bridge Backend Pattern ✅

**Examples:**
- `ofxGgmlClipBridgeBackend` - CLIP embeddings
- `ofxGgmlStableDiffusionBridgeBackend` - Image generation
- `ofxGgmlMusicGenerationBridgeBackend` - Audio generation
- `ofxGgmlTtsBridgeBackend` - Speech synthesis
- `ofxGgmlWebCrawlerBridgeBackend` - Website ingestion

**Design:** Adapter pattern with `std::function<>` callbacks

**Benefit:** Features can share backend instances (e.g., multiple consumers use same CLIP backend).

---

### 4.2 Validation Loop Framework ✅ (2026-04-23) ✨

**Implementation:** `src/inference/ofxGgmlValidationLoop.h` (~200 lines)

**Design:** Generic template-based validation loop pattern for generate→validate→refine cycles.

**Core Components:**
```cpp
template<typename TGenerated, typename TAnalysis>
class ofxGgmlValidationLoop {
public:
    using GenerateFunction = std::function<TGenerated(int attemptNumber)>;
    using ValidateFunction = std::function<TAnalysis(const TGenerated&)>;
    using ScoreFunction = std::function<float(const TGenerated&, const TAnalysis&)>;
    using RefineFunction = std::function<void(TGenerated&, const TAnalysis&, float score)>;

    void setGenerator(GenerateFunction fn);
    void setValidator(ValidateFunction fn);
    void setScorer(ScoreFunction fn);
    void setRefiner(RefineFunction fn);

    ofxGgmlValidationLoopResult<TGenerated, TAnalysis> run();
};

struct ofxGgmlValidationLoopConfig {
    int maxAttempts = 3;
    float qualityThreshold = 0.6f;
    bool enableRefinement = true;
    bool collectAllAttempts = false;
    float improvementThreshold = 0.1f;
};
```

**Features:**
- **Configurable retry logic**: Set max attempts and quality threshold
- **Progress monitoring**: Optional callbacks with cancellation support
- **Refinement loop**: Automatic retry with improvements based on feedback
- **Result aggregation**: Collects all attempts or just the best one
- **Improvement tracking**: Stops early if refinement isn't helping

**Concrete Helpers:**
```cpp
namespace ofxGgmlValidationLoops {
    // Diffusion → Vision validation loop
    ofxGgmlValidationLoopResult<...> validateDiffusionWithVision(
        const ofxGgmlImageGenerationRequest& request,
        ofxGgmlDiffusionInference* diffusion,
        ofxGgmlVisionInference* vision,
        const ofxGgmlVisionModelProfile& visionProfile,
        ofxGgmlInference* textInference,
        const ofxGgmlValidationLoopConfig& config);

    // Video Planning → CLIP validation loop
    ofxGgmlValidationLoopResult<...> validateVideoPlanWithCLIP(
        const ofxGgmlVideoPlannerRequest& request,
        const std::string& modelPath,
        const ofxGgmlInferenceSettings& settings,
        const ofxGgmlInference& inference,
        const ofxGgmlVideoPlanner& planner,
        ofxGgmlClipInference* clip,
        const ofxGgmlValidationLoopConfig& config);
}
```

**Usage Example:**
```cpp
// Custom validation loop
ofxGgmlValidationLoop<ImageResult, AnalysisResult> loop;

loop.setGenerator([&](int attempt) {
    auto request = baseRequest;
    if (attempt > 1) request.seed = -1; // Random seed for retry
    return diffusion.generate(request);
});

loop.setValidator([&](const ImageResult& result) {
    return vision.analyze(result.images[0].path);
});

loop.setScorer([](const ImageResult&, const AnalysisResult& analysis) {
    return analysis.alignmentScore;
});

loop.setRefiner([](ImageResult& result, const AnalysisResult& analysis, float score) {
    // Optionally modify parameters based on feedback
    result.refinementNotes = analysis.suggestions;
});

ofxGgmlValidationLoopConfig config;
config.maxAttempts = 5;
config.qualityThreshold = 0.8f;
loop.setConfig(config);

auto result = loop.run();
if (result.success) {
    // Use result.bestGenerated and result.bestAnalysis
}
```

**Benefit:**
- Transforms ofxGgml from "generate and hope" to "generate, verify, refine"
- Reusable pattern for all generative→analytical workflows
- Automated quality assurance with configurable thresholds
- Enables multi-attempt refinement strategies

---

### 4.3 Easy API Facade ✅

**Component:** `ofxGgmlEasy`

**Centralization:** Owns instances of:
- Inference, chat, text, vision, speech assistants
- Citation search (which owns web crawler)
- Video planner, media prompt generator, music generator
- Video essay workflow, long video planner, coding agent

**Synergy Mechanism:** `syncTextBackends()` propagates text config to 10+ components in one call.

**Gap:** No equivalent for vision/CLIP backends (each feature configures independently).

---

### 4.4 Consistent Result Types ✅

**Pattern:** All features return structured results with:
- `bool success`
- `float elapsedMs`
- `std::string error`
- Feature-specific data

**Benefit:** Easy pipeline chaining with consistent error propagation.

**Example:**
```cpp
auto citationResult = citationSearch.search(request);
if (!citationResult.success) return propagateError(citationResult);

auto scriptResult = textAssistant.custom(
    buildScriptPrompt(citationResult.citations));
if (!scriptResult.success) return propagateError(scriptResult);
```

---

## 5. IDENTIFIED OPPORTUNITIES (NOT YET IMPLEMENTED)

### 5.1 Video/Audio Analysis Not Used for Generation ⚠️

**Gap:** Analysis features produce insights but don't fully feed generation pipelines.

**Specific Opportunities:**
- Video emotion analysis → video planner scene tone hints (**✅ Complete - see Section 3.5**)
- Speech transcript keywords → music generator mood/style
- Subtitle prosody features → montage beat planning

**Note:** The video analysis hints integration (item 3.5) is now complete, addressing one key opportunity. Remaining work focuses on audio-to-generation bridges.

**Effort:** 2-4 hours per integration
**Value:** Medium (better contextual generation)

---

### 5.2 Code Assistants Isolated from Multi-Modal Features ⚠️

**Gap:** Code assistants don't leverage vision, speech, or citation capabilities.

**Missed Opportunities:**
1. **Vision + Code**: Analyze UI screenshots when reviewing React components
2. **Speech + Code**: Transcribe code review meetings → extract action items
3. **Citations + Code**: Ground code suggestions in official API documentation

**Example:**
```cpp
// Vision-enhanced code review
auto reviewResult = codeReview.review(repoPath, modelPath);
for (const auto& file : reviewResult.findings) {
    if (isUICode(file.path)) {
        auto screenshots = findRelatedScreenshots(file.path);
        for (const auto& shot : screenshots) {
            auto analysis = vision.describeImage(shot);
            // Compare to code comments/docs
        }
    }
}
```

**Effort:** 8-12 hours
**Value:** Medium (enhanced code review capabilities)

---

### 5.3 CLIP Integration Expansion ⚠️

**Current:** CLIP used for diffusion reranking, image search, and (**✅ Complete**) video scene coherence validation.

**Additional Opportunities:**
1. **Video Planning** - Validate scene coherence across multi-scene plans (**✅ Complete - see Section 3.3**)
2. **Media Translation** - Verify Music→Image translation quality (~40 lines)
3. **Vision Tasks** - Pre-filter images before expensive multimodal analysis (~30 lines)

**Note:** Video scene coherence validation (item 3.3) is now complete.

**Effort:** 1-2 hours for remaining integrations
**Value:** High (quality improvements using existing infrastructure)

---

### 5.4 Fragmented Embedding Indices ⚠️

**Problem:** Multiple features build separate embedding indices:
- Code review embeds file snippets
- Text inference embeds for RAG
- CLIP embeds images independently

**Opportunity:** Create `ofxGgmlUnifiedSemanticIndex` consolidating:
- Text embeddings (documents, code)
- CLIP embeddings (images, video frames)
- Cross-modal search (text query → both document and image results)

**Example:**
```cpp
class ofxGgmlUnifiedSemanticIndex {
    ofxGgmlEmbeddingIndex textIndex;
    ofxGgmlClipInference clipIndex;

    vector<Result> search(string query, SearchMode mode) {
        if (mode == TextOnly) return textIndex.search(query);
        if (mode == VisualOnly) return clipIndex.rankImagesForText(query);
        if (mode == MultiModal) {
            // Combine both and re-rank
        }
    }
};
```

**Effort:** 6-8 hours
**Value:** High (architectural improvement, enables new features)
