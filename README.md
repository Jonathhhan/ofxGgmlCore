# ofxGgml

`ofxGgml` is being restarted as a small, planned openFrameworks addon for
ggml-based local compute and inference.

The previous full framework has been frozen on the `legacy-full` branch. That
branch keeps the broad experimental surface: assistants, web/RAG helpers,
speech/TTS, vision, SAM/SAM3, diffusion, music/video workflows, and the large
GUI example. New `main` is the clean core line.

## Goal

Keep the default addon boring, dependable, and easy to embed:

- ggml dependency setup
- backend/runtime ownership
- tensor and graph wrappers
- GGUF/model metadata inspection
- basic text inference as a later explicit layer
- stable result/error types
- focused tests and examples

Everything else should become a companion addon or an optional layer.

## Planned Layers

| Layer | Header | Scope |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Core | `ofxGgmlCore.h` | runtime, tensors, graphs, models, results |
| Text | `ofxGgmlText.h` | small text request/result API with pluggable llama.cpp / server adapters |
| Optional companions | separate addons | vision, speech, SAM, assistants, workflows |

The first text adapter is `ofxGgmlLlamaCliTextBackend`. It builds a llama.cpp
CLI command from `ofxGgmlTextRequest` and runs it through a small native process
runner. Apps can still inject a custom command runner when they need their own
process policy while the addon keeps the text API stable.

## Status

This is the first rewrite commit. It intentionally favors a clear skeleton over
feature volume. Use `legacy-full` if you need the prior broad implementation
while this branch is rebuilt.

## Setup Direction

The addon will not vendor large generated binaries by default. Build scripts
will populate:

```text
libs/ggml/include
libs/ggml/lib
```

from the pinned upstream ggml `v0.11.0` revision.

```powershell
.\scripts\setup-ggml.ps1
.\scripts\setup-ggml.bat
.\scripts\setup-ggml.ps1 -CpuOnly
.\scripts\setup-ggml.ps1 -Cuda
.\scripts\setup-ggml.ps1 -Vulkan
.\scripts\setup-ggml.ps1 -AllBackends
```

On macOS and Linux, use the shell wrapper:

```sh
./scripts/setup-ggml.sh
./scripts/setup-ggml.sh -CpuOnly
./scripts/setup-ggml.sh -Vulkan
```

Running without backend switches is the default `-Auto` mode. Explicit backend
switches keep the build narrow, and adding `-Auto` to an explicit backend also
enables any other locally detected backend.

`-Auto` and `-AllBackends` are intentionally different:

| Option | Behavior |
| --- | --- |
| `-Auto` | Detects local SDKs/tools and enables only available backends. |
| `-AllBackends` | Requires every supported backend SDK/toolchain and fails early if one is missing. |

Explicit backend switches are requirements. For example, `-Cuda` fails before
configuration if the CUDA Toolkit cannot be found. Use default `-Auto` when you
want the script to skip unavailable GPU backends.

On Windows, the setup script locates Visual Studio C++ build tools and runs
CMake through `VsDevCmd.bat`. CUDA builds use the Visual Studio CUDA toolset;
when CUDA is combined with Vulkan or OpenCL, the script builds CUDA separately
from the native backends so ggml's nested Vulkan shader build does not inherit
the CUDA toolset.

Backend binaries remain generated local artifacts. `addon_config.mk` is updated
by the setup script to reference the ggml libraries that were actually built.
The runtime default is `ofxGgmlBackend::Auto`, which tries built GPU backends in
priority order (`CUDA`, then `Vulkan`) before falling back to CPU. Use
`ofxGgmlRuntimeSettings::preferredBackend` when an app needs to force CPU or a
specific GPU backend.

SAM3 support is optional and generated locally:

```powershell
scripts\install-sam3-cpp.bat
scripts\build-sam3-cpp.bat -Cuda -SkipExamples
```

The install script patches `sam3.cpp` with a `SAM3_CUDA` CMake option and a CUDA
backend initialization path. The build script exports `libs/sam3/lib/sam3.lib`
and enables `OFXGGML_ENABLE_SAM3_ADAPTER` in the local `addon_config.mk` SAM3
marker. By default, SAM3 builds against the addon ggml source under
`libs/ggml/.source` so the addon links a single ggml version; pass
`-BundledGgml` only when intentionally testing upstream sam3.cpp in isolation.

## Validation

Run the addon unit tests:

```powershell
scripts\test-addon.bat
scripts\test-addon.ps1
```

Build the generated openFrameworks simple example:

```powershell
scripts\build-simple-example.bat
scripts\build-simple-example.ps1 -Configuration Release
```

The examples use `ofxImGui` for their control/status panels. Keep `ofxImGui`
installed beside this addon and regenerate the project files if `addons.make`
changes are not picked up by your IDE. The Windows build helper repairs stale
generated projects enough for local smoke builds.

The simple example reports the selected runtime backend, enumerates available
devices, and runs a tiny F32 add graph as a smoke test.

Build the generated text example:

```powershell
scripts\build-text-example.bat
scripts\build-text-example.ps1 -Configuration Release
```

`ofxGgmlTextExample` defaults to a warm local `llama-server` at
`http://127.0.0.1:8080` and runs one OpenAI-compatible chat completion through
`ofxGgmlTextGenerator`. Set `OFXGGML_TEXT_SERVER_URL` or
`OFXGGML_TEXT_SERVER_MODEL` to override routing. The request runs on a worker
thread so the window paints immediately; use the ImGui buttons or press `R` to
run again and `C` to cancel after the next output chunk.

You can launch it without setting global environment variables:

```powershell
scripts\run-text-example.bat -ServerUrl http://127.0.0.1:8080
scripts\run-text-example.ps1 -ServerUrl http://127.0.0.1:8080 -ServerModel local-model
```

The old CLI fallback is still available when you explicitly request it:

```powershell
scripts\run-text-example.bat -Backend cli -LlamaCli C:\path\to\llama-cli.exe -Model C:\path\to\model.gguf
```

In CLI mode, omitted paths are auto-discovered beside the app and under local
`bin`, `data`, `tools`, `models`, and `libs/llama.cpp/build/bin` folders.

The `.sh` wrappers call the same PowerShell scripts on macOS/Linux when
PowerShell 7+ is installed. Platform project files still need to be generated by
the openFrameworks projectGenerator before building examples on each platform.
