# ofxGgml

`ofxGgml` is an openFrameworks addon for [ggml](https://github.com/ggml-org/ggml) tensors and basic local LLM inference. The supported addon tier focuses on backend selection, graph execution, GGUF model loading, server-first `llama-server` plus optional llama.cpp CLI helpers, prompt-memory utilities, and small examples that demonstrate those APIs.

Creative application workflows remain useful, but they are no longer part of the default addon boundary. Video essay, rendered-music/AceStep, MilkDrop/projectM, and Holoscan bridge code should be treated as companion-addon candidates or example-level integrations behind explicit opt-in headers.

In practice: keep `ofxGgml` boring and dependable, and build the more ambitious creative AI framework in companion projects that opt into this foundation.

## Layered API Architecture

ofxGgml uses **layered headers** - include only what you need:

| Header | What You Get | Use When |
|--------|--------------|----------|
| **`ofxGgmlBasic.h`** | **Core + text inference** | **Text/chat AI (start here!)** |
| `ofxGgml.h` | Basic + chat/text/code assistants | Default supported addon tier |
| `ofxGgmlModalities.h` | Basic + speech/vision/TTS/images/CLIP adapters | Optional multimodal adapter layer |
| `ofxGgmlWorkflows.h` | Basic + source-grounded planning/research helpers | Optional helper layer |
| `ofxGgmlCompanionWorkflows.h` | Montage/video essay/music/MilkDrop/AceStep/Holoscan prototypes | Companion/example-tier opt-in |
| `ofxGgmlAssistants.h` | Basic + code/chat assistants | AI coding assistance |
| `ofxGgmlCore.h` | Runtime, tensors, models | Low-level tensor ops only |

**Start with `ofxGgmlBasic.h`** for most projects.

**Why layered?** Faster compile times, clearer APIs, simpler examples. Each layer builds on previous ones.

See [docs/getting-started/CHOOSING_FEATURES.md](docs/getting-started/CHOOSING_FEATURES.md) for detailed guidance.

It is aimed at local-first AI tools, lightweight inference utilities, prompt-driven creative apps, and openFrameworks projects that want ggml runtime access without wiring the low-level backend API by hand.

Near-term roadmap priorities focus on:

- tighter model onboarding with downloads, verification, compatibility checks, and presets
- better observability with backend health, queue, memory, VRAM, and latency reporting
- stable tensor/model/text inference APIs that remain useful without creative workflow glue
- companion/example extraction for media-application workflows instead of growing the core addon boundary

See [docs/ROADMAP.md](docs/ROADMAP.md) for the phased roadmap.

- addon-level `Live context` support for loaded sources, domain-provider grounding, generic search fallback, and stricter citation-oriented response modes
- `ofxGgmlSpeechInference` for local speech-to-text workflows via pluggable speech backends, with ready-to-use Whisper CLI profiles
- `ofxGgmlTtsInference` as a lightweight text-to-speech bridge layer for Piper and optional `chatllm.cpp`-backed OuteTTS workflows
- `ofxGgmlClipInference` as a lightweight CLIP-style embedding and ranking bridge layer for text/image similarity workflows, with bundled `clip.cpp` support (no external dependencies required)
- `ofxGgmlDiffusionInference` as a lightweight image-generation bridge layer that can host an `ofxStableDiffusion` adapter without coupling diffusion internals into the core addon, now with structured image modes, CLIP-friendly rerank selection, and richer per-image metadata
- `ofxGgmlVisionInference` for multimodal image-to-text requests against `llama-server`-style OpenAI-compatible endpoints

- `ofxGgmlVideoPlanner` for beat planning, multi-scene sequencing, and AI-assisted edit-plan generation that can feed video, diffusion, or writing workflows
  - the planner remains generation-agnostic so apps can pair those plans with `ofxStableDiffusion`, `ofxVlc4`, or external renderers while keeping one shared planning/export manifest
- `ofxGgmlMontagePlanner` and `ofxGgmlMontagePreviewBridge` are companion/example-tier surfaces for subtitle-driven montage planning, preview tracks, and CMX-style EDL export
- `ofxGgmlHoloscanBridge` is companion/example-tier bridge code; include `ofxGgmlCompanionWorkflows.h` or move it to a companion addon when building Holoscan-style media pipelines
- `ofxGgmlImageSearch` for internet reference-image lookup through pluggable providers, with a working Wikimedia Commons backend
- `ofxGgmlWebCrawler` as an optional website-ingestion bridge layer, with a `Mojo` CLI adapter for local website-to-Markdown crawling workflows

- `ofxGgmlVideoEssayWorkflow` is kept as companion/example-tier orchestration for `topic -> cited outline -> narrated script -> voice cues -> SRT -> visual concept -> scene/edit planning`, not as a default addon surface
- `ofxGgmlMediaPromptGenerator` for local-first cross-media prompt translation, starting with `Music -> Image` prompt generation that can reuse transcripts, lyrics, and existing text backends before handing the result to diffusion workflows
- `ofxGgmlMusicGenerator`, `ofxGgmlAceStepBridge`, and `ofxGgmlMilkDropGenerator` are companion/example-tier prototypes for music and visualization workflows
- `ofxGgmlEasy` as a small high-level facade for common text, chat, translation, and explicitly included optional modality/workflow tasks without wiring the lower-level assistants by hand
- `ofxGgmlEasy` covers crawler-backed citation research and AI-assisted video-edit planning by default; montage and other companion workflow helpers are available only when `OFXGGML_ENABLE_COMPANION_WORKFLOWS=1` is defined before including the Easy header
- `ofxGgmlEasy` now keeps text inference, crawling, and citation search on one persistent helper path, so `configureText()`, `configureWebCrawler()`, `getWebCrawler()`, `getCitationSearch()`, and `findCitations()` operate on the same configured pipeline
- `ofxGgmlEasy` now also exposes lightweight onboarding helpers for text-model preset discovery, per-task recommendations, and setup diagnostics backed by `scripts/model-catalog.json`
  - the companion-tier `Video Essay` example can hand Phase 3 output into an optional `ofxVlc4` preview/render lane in the GUI example
- `ofxGgmlChatAssistant` for reusable chat prompts, response-language control, and UI-thin conversation flows
- `ofxGgmlCodeAssistant` for coding-oriented prompts, structured task plans, unified diff output, compile-database-aware semantic retrieval, inline completion, repo context, focused-file assistance, and follow-up scripting actions
- `ofxGgmlCodeAssistant` now also exposes lightweight assistant sessions, a typed tool registry, approval callbacks for risky proposals, and streamed assistant events so apps can build safer IDE-style coding flows without reimplementing orchestration
- `ofxGgmlCodingAgent` as a thin orchestration layer on top of the code and workspace assistants, with persistent session memory, a read-only `Plan` mode, optional patch application, and verification-aware coding runs
- the GUI example Script mode now surfaces that assistant runtime directly with a default simple ChatPilot-style UI plus optional full `Build` / `Plan` controls, `@` references including read-oriented `@general`, quick slash/intents chips, streamed tool/approval status, and explicit approve/deny handling for risky proposals
- `ofxGgmlWorkspaceAssistant` for validated patch application, allow-listed edit enforcement, unified-diff transactions with rollback, shadow-workspace safe apply, auto-selected verification commands, and retry-oriented coding loops on top of structured assistant output
- coding workflows now carry lightweight task memory such as active mode, selected backend, recent files, and last failure reason so retries and follow-up prompts stay more grounded
- structured coding prompts now push a clearer inspect -> patch -> verify loop, stronger self-check instructions, and recovery from weak unstructured model replies
- `ofxGgmlTextAssistant` for translation, summarization, rewriting, and reusable text-task prompts
- `ofxGgmlCodeReview`, `ofxGgmlProjectMemory`, and `ofxGgmlScriptSource` helpers for local coding and multi-pass review workflows
- `ofxGgmlScriptSource` now accepts local folders, Visual Studio `.sln` / `.vcxproj` workspaces, GitHub `owner/repo` values, full GitHub URLs, and branch-aware repo URLs
- assistant eval coverage for retrieval quality, dry-run safety, and structured workspace execution
- async graph submission and explicit synchronization for frame-friendly compute
- Windows build scripts that refresh Visual Studio linking automatically
- GUI example for local chat, review, and script-assisted workflows built mostly on addon helpers
  - GUI example `Easy` mode now demonstrates the high-level `ofxGgmlEasy` facade directly, including one-click chat, summarize, translate, citation search, `Video Essay`, and coding-agent `Plan` flows using the currently selected backend/model
    - GUI example sidebar loading is now more centralized: `Video` now separates its text planner model from a dedicated video-render model preset/override lane, text modes can override the selected preset with any local GGUF path, and `Image` mode now keeps diffusion model / VAE / init / mask loading together in one shared sidebar section
  - GUI example Vision mode now also includes a small `Holoscan Bridge` section for live frame submission and inline preview.
    - The native Holoscan runtime path is opt-in with `OFXGGML_ENABLE_HOLOSCAN=1` and Linux-only for now; Windows and other platforms stay on the addon fallback lane until that runtime is validated there.
  - GUI example Translate mode with auto-detect source language, natural vs. literal translation shortcuts, detect-and-translate flow, and more reliable prompt/input handoff buttons
  - GUI example Chat and Translate modes now each keep a dedicated lightweight TTS preview lane, so spoken replies and translated voice output can be played, restarted, and stopped inline without bouncing through the main TTS panel
  - GUI example `Video Essay` mode now also supports optional `ofxVlc4` preview/render handoff, so a source video plus the generated essay SRT can be previewed live and texture-recorded into a muxed narration render without leaving the example
  - GUI example `Montage` mode now also includes a clip-playlist export lane for generated or curated clip paths, with JSON playlist-manifest export, optional `ofxVlc4` playlist preview, and texture-recorded render export with optional external-audio mux
  - that same Montage playlist lane can now auto-collect generated video outputs such as rendered essay videos or previous montage renders, merge them into the current clip list, and start preview/record export as soon as the first VLC frame is ready
  - GUI example Montage mode can now preview restructured subtitle cues live, copy generated SRT/VTT exports, and keep a playback-facing subtitle track ready for external preview layers such as `ofxVlc4`
  - when the GUI example is regenerated with `ofxVlc4` enabled in `addons.make`, Montage mode can also load the active subtitle track directly into an optional `ofxVlc4` preview with subtitle delay / scale controls
  - that same Montage area can now also collect clip paths into a small playlist manifest, preview the sequence through an optional second `ofxVlc4` lane, and record the playlist back out to a video file with optional audio mux
  - `ofxVlc4` is no longer included in the default `ofxGgmlGuiExample/addons.make`; add it back manually only if you want those optional VLC preview and texture-record export lanes
- GUI example Summarize mode now includes a dedicated citation-research section that can extract quoted evidence from loaded URLs or crawl a seed website before building a cited summary
- GUI example Diffusion mode now includes a `Music -> Image` helper that can turn a music caption plus optional lyrics/transcript into a reusable visual prompt for the existing diffusion flow
- GUI example Vision mode now also includes a dedicated `Music Video` workflow section that can turn song text into a visual concept, apply music-video planning defaults, and hand the result directly into video planning, diffusion, and edit-plan generation
- the shared video planner now also supports music-video-aware section planning, including intro / verse / chorus / bridge style sections, section-level energy and cut-density hints, and section summaries that feed prompt generation and Music Video planning review
- GUI example Vision mode now also includes an `Image / Prompt -> Music` helper that can turn a scene description into a reusable music-generation prompt and a local ABC notation sketch, with direct handoff into Custom mode or `.abc` saving
- GUI example MilkDrop mode can generate `.milk` preset text from prompts, save presets, and optionally preview the result live through `ofxProjectM` when the example is regenerated with that addon enabled
- GUI example MilkDrop mode now also includes validation, preset repair, quick variants, and projectM preview controls for beat sensitivity, preset duration, and microphone-driven reactive preview while Speech recording is active

## Source layout

The main public API stays in:

- `src/ofxGgml.h`

Core implementation is split by concern:

- `src/core/` for runtime entry points, shared types, helpers, and version metadata
- `src/compute/` for tensors and graph building
- `src/model/` for GGUF model loading
- `src/inference/` for completion execution, grounded prompt assembly, and speech / vision / video inference helpers
- `src/inference/` also now includes bridge scaffolds for optional CLIP-style ranking, TTS, diffusion/image-generation, segmentation, and music-generation backends such as `clip.cpp`, OuteTTS, `ofxStableDiffusion`, `sam.cpp`, and future rendered-audio generators, plus higher-level planners and preview bridges for video, media-prompt translation, image search, and companion montage workflows
- `src/inference/` also now includes optional web-ingestion helpers such as `ofxGgmlWebCrawler` plus topic-oriented quote extraction via `ofxGgmlCitationSearch` for local crawler-backed RAG/document pipelines
- `src/bridges/` for optional companion runtime bridges such as the Holoscan-backed live vision lane
- `src/assistants/` for chat, code, workspace, review, and text-task helpers
- `src/support/` for script sources, project memory, and the high-level `ofxGgmlEasy` facade

Supporting areas:

- `libs/ggml/`
- `scripts/` for user-facing setup, build, download, and benchmark entry points
  - includes `scripts/install-acestep.ps1` / `scripts/install-acestep.bat` for building a local AceStep runtime while keeping only the final launcher/runtime binaries under `libs/acestep/bin`
- `scripts/dev/` for maintainer update and patching helpers
- `docs/`
- `tests/`
- `ofxGgmlBasicExample/`
- `ofxGgmlGuiExample/`
- `ofxGgmlNeuralExample/`
- `ofxGgmlWebScrapingExample/`

Developer tooling:

- repo-level `.clang-tidy` for addon/example static-analysis defaults
- `scripts/run-clang-tidy.ps1` for Windows / Visual Studio workflows
- `scripts/run-clang-tidy.sh` for Linux/macOS compile-database workflows
- `docs/CLANG_TIDY.md` for usage and recommended scope
- `docs/OFXIMGUI_ASSISTANT_SPEC.md` for the proposed specialized `ofxImGui` / openFrameworks GUI assistant design

## Compatibility policy

`ofxGgml` can work alongside optional companion addons such as `ofxStableDiffusion`, but the recommended policy is:

- pin tested upstream revisions instead of following `main`
- keep `ofxGgml` and `ofxStableDiffusion` as separate integrations
- avoid manual copying of stale `ggml*.dll` files into example `bin` folders
- treat "tested together" as an explicit release note, not an assumption

The full versioning and runtime-packaging guidance lives in:

- `docs/COMPATIBILITY.md`

Short version: prefer a compatibility matrix over "latest everywhere", and only consider one shared `ggml` build when both upstreams are verified against the same revision and you are ready to maintain that coupling.

## Clone / install quick start

Clone the addon into your openFrameworks `addons` folder:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Jonathhhan/ofxGgml.git
```

Then run the setup script for your platform:

```bash
cd ofxGgml
./scripts/setup_linux_macos.sh
```

```bat
cd ofxGgml
scripts\setup_windows.bat
```

> [!WARNING]
> **First run is not optional:** `libs/ggml/` is intentionally empty when you clone the addon. The examples will usually fail to build or launch until you run the platform setup script, build the bundled ggml libraries, and regenerate the example project with the openFrameworks Project Generator.
>
> Minimum first-run flow:
> - run `./scripts/setup_linux_macos.sh` or `scripts\setup_windows.bat`
> - run `./scripts/build-ggml.sh` or `scripts\build-ggml.bat`
> - regenerate the example project before building it

After setup, add `ofxGgml` to your project's `addons.make`, regenerate with the openFrameworks Project Generator when needed, and build normally.

By default, helper scripts now prefer a shared addon-level model folder:

- `models/`

That keeps large GGUF / Whisper model files out of per-example `bin/data/models` copies during development. The GUI example still falls back to bundled `bin/data/models` when you package a standalone app.

In the current GUI example:

  - `Video` mode now keeps planner and render model selection separate:
  - the shared catalog still provides an optional text planner preset for chunk/continuity planning
  - the sidebar also exposes a dedicated `Video Render Model` section with its own optional video-generation presets, custom local model override, and download link
- the shared sidebar can override the selected text-model preset with any local GGUF file through `Browse GGUF...`
- `Image` mode keeps diffusion asset loading centralized in the sidebar under `Image Assets`, including diffusion model, optional VAE, init image, and inpaint mask image

On Windows, the GUI example also adds central runtime folders such as:

- `libs/llama/bin`
- `libs/whisper/bin`
- `libs/chatllm/bin`
- `libs/piper/bin`
- `libs/ggml/lib`

to the process DLL search path at startup, so development builds do not need duplicate runtime DLL copies in `bin/` unless you are distributing a standalone bundle.

## Easy API

If you want a shorter setup path than wiring `ofxGgmlInference`, `ofxGgmlTextAssistant`, `ofxGgmlVisionInference`, and `ofxGgmlSpeechInference` manually, use `ofxGgmlEasy`.

`ofxGgmlEasy` keeps one owned crawler/citation path internally. Configuration changes made through `configureText()`, `configureWebCrawler()`, `getWebCrawler()`, or `getCitationSearch()` are reused by later `crawlWebsite()` and `findCitations()` calls instead of being rebuilt on a separate temporary helper.

For coding workflows that need more than a single prompt, `ofxGgmlCodingAgent` now sits between `ofxGgmlCodeAssistant` and `ofxGgmlWorkspaceAssistant`. It keeps a reusable coding session, can stay read-only in `Plan` mode, and can optionally apply and verify structured edits in one run.

Minimal text setup:

```cpp
#include "ofxGgml.h" // default core + text/assistant tier
#include "support/ofxGgmlEasy.h" // optional high-level facade

ofxGgmlEasy ai;

ofxGgmlEasyTextConfig text;
text.modelPath = "data/models/qwen2.5-1.5b-instruct-q4_k_m.gguf";
text.completionExecutable = "llama-completion";
ai.configureText(text);

auto summary = ai.summarize("Summarize this paragraph in one sentence.");
if (summary.inference.success) {
    ofLogNotice() << summary.inference.text;
}
```

Onboarding helpers for the first roadmap step:

```cpp
auto presets = ai.listTextModelPresets("scripts/model-catalog.json");
auto recommendation = ai.recommendTextModelForTask("script", "scripts/model-catalog.json");
auto setup = ai.inspectTextSetup("script", "scripts/model-catalog.json");
auto diagnostics = ai.inspectTextDiagnostics("script", "scripts/model-catalog.json");
auto download = ai.planTextModelDownload("script", 0, "scripts/model-catalog.json", "models");

if (!setup.ready && recommendation) {
    ofLogNotice() << "Suggested preset: #" << recommendation->preset
                  << " " << recommendation->name;
}
```

`inspectTextSetup()` reports GGUF compatibility hints, missing embedding support for hybrid retrieval, and server-model routing warnings. `inspectTextDiagnostics()` combines setup and health into a severity-tagged report with JSON serialization for GUI panels and support dumps. `planTextModelDownload()` turns a recommended preset into a concrete download plan with checksum/provenance metadata and a ready-to-run `download-model.sh --require-checksum` command for verified presets.

Chat and translation:

```cpp
auto chat = ai.chat("Explain ggml in simple terms.", "English");
auto translated = ai.translate("Guten Morgen", "English", "German");
```

Vision:

```cpp
#include "ofxGgmlModalities.h"

ofxGgmlEasyVisionConfig vision;
vision.modelPath = "data/models/LFM2.5-VL-1.6B-Q8_0.gguf";
vision.mmprojPath = "data/models/mmproj-LFM2.5-VL-1.6b-Q8_0.gguf";
vision.serverUrl = "http://127.0.0.1:8080";
ai.configureVision(vision);

auto imageResult = ai.describeImage("data/images/test.png");
```

Speech:

```cpp
#include "ofxGgmlModalities.h"

ofxGgmlEasySpeechConfig speech;
speech.modelPath = "data/models/ggml-base.en.bin";
speech.cliExecutable = "whisper-cli";
ai.configureSpeech(speech);

auto transcript = ai.transcribeAudio("data/audio/test.wav");
```

Research and edit workflows:

```cpp
#include "ofxGgmlWorkflows.h"
#include "support/ofxGgmlEasy.h"

ofxGgmlEasyCrawlerConfig crawler;
crawler.executablePath = "mojo";
ai.configureWebCrawler(crawler);

auto citations = ai.findCitations(
    "Berlin airport winter disruption",
    {},
    "https://example.com/weather",
    4);

auto interceptedCitations = ai.findCitationsFromInput(
    "find sources about Berlin airport winter disruption",
    {},
    "https://example.com/weather",
    4);

// Citation search now rewrites/refines the topic and reuses the shared
// RAG retrieval path for hybrid lexical + embedding-aware source chunk ranking
// when embeddings are configured, with lexical fallback otherwise. Repeated
// retrievals now also reuse an in-memory RAG cache by default.

auto editPlan = ai.planVideoEdit(
    "Berlin city footage",
    "Turn this into a fast social recap.",
    "Opening skyline, transit, crowd reaction.");

// Montage, music, AceStep, MilkDrop, video essay, and Holoscan prototypes are
// companion/example-tier surfaces. Define OFXGGML_ENABLE_COMPANION_WORKFLOWS=1
// before including ofxGgmlEasy.h, or include ofxGgmlCompanionWorkflows.h in
// examples that intentionally opt into those APIs.
```

**Workflow Presets** (v1.1.0+):

Chain common AI workflows with a single method call:

```cpp
// Summarize then translate
auto result = ai.summarizeAndTranslate(
    longArticleText,
    "Spanish",  // target language
    "English",  // source language (or "Auto detect")
    150);       // max summary words

cout << "Summary: " << result.getIntermediateResult(0) << endl;
cout << "Translation: " << result.finalOutput << endl;
cout << "Total time: " << result.totalElapsedMs << "ms" << endl;

// Transcribe audio then summarize transcript
auto audioResult = ai.transcribeAndSummarize("interview.mp3", 100);

// Describe image then analyze with text model
auto visionResult = ai.describeAndAnalyze(
    "scene.jpg",
    "Analyze the artistic style and composition");

// Crawl website then summarize findings
auto webResult = ai.crawlAndSummarize("https://example.com", 2, 200);
```

Workflow results include:
- `intermediateResults` - Outputs from each step
- `finalOutput` - Final result
- `totalElapsedMs` - End-to-end timing
- `success` / `error` - Status information

`ofxGgmlEasy` is intentionally small. If you need deeper control, it still exposes the owned lower-level helpers:

- `getInference()`
- `getChatAssistant()`
- `getTextAssistant()`
- `getVisionInference()`
- `getSpeechInference()`
- `getWebCrawler()`
- `getCitationSearch()`
- `getMediaPromptGenerator()`
- `getVideoPlanner()`
- companion-tier getters such as `getVideoEssayWorkflow()`, `getMusicGenerator()`, and `getMilkDropGenerator()` only when `OFXGGML_ENABLE_COMPANION_WORKFLOWS=1`

## Quick Wins: Developer Experience Features

ofxGgml includes high-impact features for improved developer experience. See `docs/ROADMAP.md` for detailed quick-win and roadmap documentation.

### Batched Inference API

Process multiple inference requests efficiently with automatic parallelization and fallback:

```cpp
ofxGgmlInference inference;
std::vector<std::string> prompts = {
    "Summarize quantum computing",
    "Explain neural networks",
    "What is machine learning?"
};

ofxGgmlInferenceSettings settings;
settings.maxTokens = 256;
settings.useServerBackend = true;

auto result = inference.generateBatchSimple("model.gguf", prompts, settings);
std::cout << "Processed: " << result.processedCount << " requests in "
          << result.totalElapsedMs << "ms" << std::endl;
```

Features:
- Concurrent processing for server backends (configurable parallelism)
- Sequential fallback for CLI backends
- Per-request settings and streaming callbacks
- Built-in metrics tracking via `ofxGgmlMetrics`
- Batch embeddings support, now with bounded concurrent server requests instead of a purely sequential loop

Default text-generation settings now lean toward smoother general-purpose prose out of the box (`temperature = 0.8`, `topP = 0.95`, `minP = 0.03`, `repeatPenalty = 1.05`), while CLI and server backends share the same cleanup and completion-finishing behavior.

See `docs/BATCH_INFERENCE.md` for comprehensive documentation.

### Streaming API with Backpressure Control

`ofxGgmlStreamingContext` provides pause/resume/cancel capabilities and flow control:

```cpp
auto ctx = std::make_shared<ofxGgmlStreamingContext>();
ctx->setBackpressureThreshold(1000);

inference.generate(modelPath, prompt, settings, [ctx](const std::string& chunk) {
    if (ctx->shouldPause()) ctx->waitForResume(5000);
    if (ctx->isCancelled()) return false;
    processChunk(chunk);
    return true;
});
```

**Enhanced Progress Tracking** (v1.1.0+):

Track detailed streaming progress with token counts, speed, and completion percentage:

```cpp
auto ctx = std::make_shared<ofxGgmlStreamingContext>();
ctx->setEstimatedTotal(settings.maxTokens);

inference.generate(modelPath, prompt, settings, [ctx](const std::string& chunk) {
    ctx->addTokens(1); // Increment for each token/chunk

    auto progress = ctx->getProgress(chunk);
    ofLogNotice() << "Progress: " << (progress.percentComplete * 100.0f) << "% "
                  << "Speed: " << progress.tokensPerSecond << " tok/s "
                  << "Elapsed: " << progress.elapsedMs << "ms";

    if (ctx->isCancelled()) return false;
    return true;
});
```

Progress information includes:
- `tokensGenerated` - Current token count
- `estimatedTotal` - Expected total (from maxTokens)
- `percentComplete` - Progress as 0.0 to 1.0
- `tokensPerSecond` - Generation speed
- `elapsedMs` - Time since start

### Logging and Metrics

`ofxGgmlLogger` provides configurable logging, and `ofxGgmlMetrics` tracks performance:

```cpp
auto& logger = ofxGgmlLogger::getInstance();
logger.setLevel(ofxGgmlLogger::Level::Debug);
logger.info("Inference", "Starting generation");

auto& metrics = ofxGgmlMetrics::getInstance();
metrics.recordInferenceStart("llama-7b");
// ... inference ...
metrics.recordInferenceEnd("llama-7b", tokens, elapsedMs);
std::cout << metrics.getSummary();
```

### Memory Usage and Server Monitoring

Monitor resource consumption and server status for production deployments:

```cpp
// Check memory usage
ofxGgml runtime;
runtime.setup();
auto memory = runtime.getMemoryUsage();
std::cout << "Model weights: " << (memory.modelWeightBytes / 1024 / 1024) << " MB" << std::endl;
std::cout << "Total allocated: " << (memory.totalAllocatedBytes / 1024 / 1024) << " MB" << std::endl;
std::cout << "Backend: " << memory.backendName << std::endl;

// Monitor server queue
ofxGgmlInference inference;
auto queueStatus = ofxGgmlInference::getServerQueueStatus("http://127.0.0.1:8080");
if (queueStatus.available) {
    std::cout << "Queue length: " << queueStatus.queueLength << std::endl;
    std::cout << "Processing: " << queueStatus.processingCount << std::endl;
    std::cout << "Completed: " << queueStatus.completedCount << std::endl;
}

ofxGgmlEasy ai;
ofxGgmlEasyTextConfig text;
text.modelPath = "data/models/qwen2.5-1.5b-instruct-q4_k_m.gguf";
text.completionExecutable = "llama-completion";
ai.configureText(text);

auto health = ai.inspectTextHealth(&runtime);
std::cout << "Avg latency: " << health.averageLatencyMs << " ms" << std::endl;
std::cout << "Retrieval cache hit rate: " << health.retrievalCacheHitRate << std::endl;
```

These monitoring APIs are essential for:
- Diagnosing memory issues and optimizing resource usage
- Load balancing across multiple server instances
- Detecting server overload conditions
- Performance profiling and capacity planning

### Model Version Management

`ofxGgmlModelRegistry` enables hot-swapping between model versions:

```cpp
auto& registry = ofxGgmlModelRegistry::getInstance();
registry.registerModel(metadata_v1);
registry.registerModel(metadata_v2);
registry.setActiveVersion("llama-7b", "v2-q5"); // Hot-swap
std::string path = registry.getActiveModelPath("llama-7b");
```

### Prompt Template Library

`ofxGgmlPromptTemplates` provides 30+ reusable templates:

```cpp
auto& templates = ofxGgmlPromptTemplates::getInstance();
std::string prompt = templates.fill("summarize", {
    {"text", content},
    {"max_length", "3 sentences"}
});
```

## clang-tidy

`ofxGgml` now ships with a repo-level `clang-tidy` configuration and helper scripts.

Windows / Visual Studio:

```powershell
./scripts/run-clang-tidy.ps1
./scripts/run-clang-tidy.ps1 -UseMsBuild
./scripts/run-clang-tidy.ps1 -Files src/core/ofxGgmlCore.cpp,src/inference/ofxGgmlInference.cpp
```

Linux / macOS:

```bash
./scripts/run-clang-tidy.sh
./scripts/run-clang-tidy.sh src/core/ofxGgmlCore.cpp src/inference/ofxGgmlInference.cpp
```

The scripts prefer a `compile_commands.json` database when available and keep analysis scoped to addon/example code rather than vendored `libs/`.

More detailed guidance lives in:

- `docs/CLANG_TIDY.md`

## Supported operations

- element-wise: add, sub, mul, div, scale, clamp, sqr, sqrt
- matrix: matMul, transpose, permute, reshape, view
- reductions: sum, mean, argmax
- normalization: norm, rmsNorm
- activations: relu, gelu, silu, sigmoid, tanh, softmax
- transformer: flashAttn, rope
- convolution and pooling: conv1d, convTranspose1d, pool1d, pool2d, upscale
- loss: crossEntropyLoss

## Requirements

- openFrameworks `0.12+`
- CMake `3.18+` for building bundled ggml
- C++17 compiler
- optional GPU toolchains:
  - CUDA Toolkit
  - Vulkan SDK
  - Metal framework on macOS
- `ofxGgmlGuiExample` additionally needs [ofxImGui](https://github.com/jvcleave/ofxImGui)

## Building ggml

Bundled ggml lives in `libs/ggml/` and is built as a static library. By default the setup scripts auto-detect available GPU backends. Use `--cpu-only` to force a CPU-only build, or explicit flags such as `--cuda`, `--vulkan`, or `--metal` when you want a fixed backend set.

> Windows / Visual Studio users should build ggml before opening a generated OF project, otherwise the linker will fail on missing `ggml.lib`.

### Automated setup

Linux and macOS:

```bash
./scripts/setup_linux_macos.sh
./scripts/setup_linux_macos.sh --cuda
./scripts/setup_linux_macos.sh --skip-model
./scripts/setup_linux_macos.sh --with-llama-cli --skip-model
./scripts/setup_linux_macos.sh --skip-model
./scripts/setup_linux_macos.sh --skip-ggml --model-preset 2
```

Windows:

```bat
scripts\setup_windows.bat
scripts\setup_windows.bat --cuda
scripts\setup_windows.bat --skip-model
scripts\setup_windows.bat --with-llama-cli --skip-model
scripts\setup_windows.bat --skip-ggml --model-preset 2
```

`download-model` covers the text GGUF presets used by chat/script/write flows. Catalog presets are loaded only after the signed manifest is validated, official catalog entries must publish SHA256 checksums, and `--require-checksum` (or `OFXGGML_REQUIRE_MODEL_CHECKSUM=1`) makes custom downloads fail unless a checksum is supplied. Speech (`Whisper`) and multimodal `Vision` models are configured separately in the addon and GUI example because they use different runtimes and file layouts. The current Vision defaults favor EU-safe llama-server profiles such as `LFM2.5-VL` for general image understanding and `GLM-OCR` for OCR-heavy work.

### AceStep music backend

The music tools are split intentionally:

- `Image -> Music` prompt generation and ABC sketch generation stay local-first and do not require AceStep
- rendered audio generation and audio understanding do require an external AceStep-compatible server

To install a local AceStep checkout into the addon:

```powershell
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\scripts\install-acestep.ps1
```

```bat
scripts\install-acestep.bat
```

The installer now auto-detects the remote default branch when possible, falls back across common branch names (`main`, `master`, `dev`, `trunk`), and initializes required submodules so upstream branch/layout changes fail less often.

By default the helper now keeps the heavy checkout/build tree outside the addon under `%LOCALAPPDATA%\ofxGgml\acestep\`, copies the final runtime files into:

- `libs/acestep/bin`

and prunes the temporary source/build artifacts after a successful install. Pass `-KeepArtifacts` if you intentionally want to keep the checkout/build tree for debugging.

After starting the AceStep server, open the GUI example's `Vision -> AceStep Music Backend` section and use `Check AceStep server` to verify that the configured URL is reachable.

`setup_windows.bat` and `setup_linux_macos.sh` now follow the server-first path by default: they build `ggml`, leave the local `llama.cpp` runtime optional, and let you opt into addon-local `llama-server` plus CLI fallback tools with `--with-llama-cli` only when you want them.

### ggml only

Linux and macOS:

```bash
./scripts/build-ggml.sh
./scripts/build-ggml.sh --auto
./scripts/build-ggml.sh --cuda
./scripts/build-ggml.sh --vulkan
./scripts/build-ggml.sh --cpu-only
```

Windows (wrapper uses Git Bash or WSL to call the same helper):

```bat
scripts\build-ggml.bat
scripts\build-ggml.bat --cuda
scripts\build-ggml.bat --vulkan
scripts\build-ggml.bat --cpu-only
scripts\build-ggml.bat --with-debug
```

The `.bat` wrapper forwards all flags to `scripts/build-ggml.sh`, so make sure `bash` is on `PATH` (Git Bash or WSL). The helper builds Release ggml libraries by default; add `--with-debug` when you also want Debug artifacts for Visual Studio multi-config builds.

After building ggml, regenerate your project with the openFrameworks Project Generator so generated Visual Studio projects pick up the latest addon library list.

`scripts/build-ggml.sh` (and the Windows wrapper) also refreshes `addon_config.mk` for the `vs` section so Visual Studio can track the ggml libraries present in your local build. The checked-in `addon_config.mk` stays CPU-safe by default, so rerun the helper on the machine that built ggml before regenerating your Visual Studio project if you enabled optional backends.

### Streaming support

`OFXGGML_HAS_SERVER_STREAMING` is enabled for server-backed text inference. Linux/macOS use the built-in portable HTTP streaming transport for `http://` local servers, which is covered by headless CI with a mock SSE server. Windows continues to use the native WinHTTP transport for the same OpenAI-compatible stream format.

| Platform | `OFXGGML_HAS_SERVER_STREAMING` | Server request behavior |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Windows | Enabled | Live token streaming via WinHTTP |
| Linux | Enabled | Live token streaming via built-in portable HTTP (`http://`) |
| macOS | Enabled | Live token streaming via built-in portable HTTP (`http://`) |

### llama-server on Windows

Use the dedicated PowerShell helper to clone `ggml-org/llama.cpp`, build the local text runtime, and copy the server plus CLI fallback tools into `libs/llama/bin`.

```powershell
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\scripts\build-llama-server.ps1
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\scripts\build-llama-server.ps1 -Cuda
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\scripts\build-llama-server.ps1 -CpuOnly
```

```bat
scripts\build-llama-server.bat
scripts\build-llama-server.bat -Cuda
scripts\build-llama-server.bat -CpuOnly
```

By default the script:

- uses `build\llama-src` for the upstream source checkout
- uses `build\llama-bld` for the CMake build tree
- installs `llama-server.exe`, `llama-completion.exe`, `llama-cli.exe`, and the required DLLs into `libs\llama\bin`
- installs `llama-embedding.exe` too when that target is available in the upstream checkout
- forces `GGML_VULKAN=OFF` in this Windows helper to avoid long-path MSBuild failures inside the Vulkan shader generator subtree

That install location matches the GUI example's local server discovery and CLI fallback probing, so server-backed text modes can auto-launch the local server during app setup and still fall back to addon-local `llama-completion` / `llama-cli` from the same `llama.cpp` checkout.

For Linux and macOS, the shell helper now follows the same addon-local runtime pattern:

```bash
./scripts/build-llama-cli.sh --auto
./scripts/start-llama-server.sh
```

To launch the local server manually after building it:

```powershell
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\scripts\start-llama-server.ps1
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\scripts\start-llama-server.ps1 -Detached
```

The helpers default to `http://127.0.0.1:8080`, reuse the recommended local GGUF model when possible, and expose GPU layers / context size flags so the server path matches the GUI example's defaults more closely.

### Build ggml locally

The repository keeps `libs/ggml` empty (include/lib placeholders only). Use the helper to fetch ggml from upstream and populate `libs/ggml/include` and `libs/ggml/lib`:

```bash
./scripts/build-ggml.sh --cpu-only      # CPU only
./scripts/build-ggml.sh --cuda          # Force CUDA backend
./scripts/build-ggml.sh --vulkan        # Force Vulkan backend
./scripts/build-ggml.sh --metal         # Force Metal backend (macOS)
```

The script downloads ggml (default ref: v0.10.0), builds static libraries, copies headers/libs into `libs/ggml`, and refreshes `addon_config.mk` library lists. Use `--clean` to wipe previous build/cache.

## Getting Started

### Quick Start (5 minutes)

See [docs/getting-started/QUICKSTART.md](docs/getting-started/QUICKSTART.md)

### Learning Path

1. **Text-only AI**: [docs/getting-started/BASIC_INFERENCE.md](docs/getting-started/BASIC_INFERENCE.md)
2. **Speech/Vision**: [docs/features/MODALITIES.md](docs/features/MODALITIES.md)
3. **Video/Research**: [docs/features/WORKFLOWS.md](docs/features/WORKFLOWS.md)
4. **Code Assistants**: [docs/features/ASSISTANTS.md](docs/features/ASSISTANTS.md)

### Which Features Do I Need?

See [docs/getting-started/CHOOSING_FEATURES.md](docs/getting-started/CHOOSING_FEATURES.md) to pick the right subset.

## Examples

### Focused Examples (Recommended for Learning)

- `ofxGgmlChatExample`: **Simple chat application** (~200 lines, uses `ofxGgmlBasic.h`)
- `ofxGgmlBasicExample`: Interactive matrix demo plus steady-state matmul benchmark
- `ofxGgmlNeuralExample`: Reusable inference graph with live class bars and latency view
- `ofxGgmlWebScrapingExample`: Keyboard-driven website crawl viewer for `ofxGgmlWebCrawler`

### Showcase Example

- `ofxGgmlGuiExample`: Showcase for API layers and UI patterns, not a test harness. Keep complex workflows in focused examples, tutorial projects, or companion addons instead of growing this example further; see `ofxGgmlGuiExample/README.md`.

The lightweight examples are keyboard-driven so you can rerun compute and benchmark paths without restarting the app.

## Tests

The test suite lives in `tests/` and covers core runtime behavior, model loading, inference helpers, chat/code/text assistants, and project memory support. When you change backend setup, Windows linking, or inference command assembly, it is worth rerunning the tests or at least rebuilding one example project.

The CLIP bridge tests now compile the bundled `libs/clip/src/clip.cpp` adapter into `ofxGgml-tests`. To run the optional real-model smoke test, set `OFXGGML_TEST_CLIP_MODEL=/absolute/path/to/model.gguf` before `./tests/run-tests.sh`. If you also set `OFXGGML_TEST_CLIP_IMAGE=/absolute/path/to/image.png`, the same test will verify image embedding too.

Windows quick check:

```powershell
cmake -S tests -B tests/build
cmake --build tests/build --config Release
./tests/build/Release/ofxGgml-tests.exe
```

Recent default-tier coverage additions include newer split inference text-cleanup paths and updated speech / translate assistant flows. Companion coverage can be enabled for montage preview/export and other example-tier workflows when those APIs are intentionally in scope.

## Persistent Server Backend

`ofxGgmlInference` can now target a warm `llama-server` process for both text generation and embeddings. When `serverModel` is left empty, the addon probes `/v1/models`, caches the active model briefly, and reuses that information across nearby requests. Review and retrieval flows can also use the same server, which keeps hierarchical review fast while preserving semantic ranking.

The GUI example couples a preferred text backend to each text-capable mode, stores that preference with the session, and now defaults every text mode to `llama-server`.

When the server backend is selected, the GUI:

- auto-applies server-friendly defaults for the active text mode
- auto-probes the configured server URL
- auto-launches a local `llama-server` during app setup when the URL points at the default local endpoint and a local server binary is available
- keeps the sidebar focused on passive status and configuration rather than manual server-management buttons

When the CLI backend is selected, it is treated as an optional fallback path rather than a required default. The sidebar now makes that explicit and keeps the missing-CLI state informational instead of presenting it as a broken primary setup.

Text-heavy modes also ship with server-friendly quick actions so the warm backend is useful outside of coding:

- `Chat`: `Summarize Chat`
- `Summarize`: `Executive Brief`, `Action Items`, `Meeting Notes`, `Source Brief`
- `Write`: `Shorten`, `Email Reply`, `Release Notes`, `Commit Message`
- `Translate`: `Natural`, `Literal`, `Detect + Translate`
- `Custom`: `JSON Reply`, `Professional Tone`

## Performance

`ofxGgml` now ships with explicit benchmark entry points and performance optimizations.

### Quick Performance Tips

**For best inference performance:**
1. **Use server mode** - `settings.useServerBackend = true` (10-50ms faster per request)
2. **Prompt caching** - Enabled by default for 2-5x speedup in multi-turn workflows
3. **Batch API** - Process multiple requests in parallel with `generateBatch()`

**Run benchmarks:**

```bash
./scripts/benchmark-addon.sh
```

```powershell
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\scripts\benchmark-addon.ps1
```

These wrappers configure the test suite with `OFXGGML_ENABLE_BENCHMARK_TESTS=ON`, build `ofxGgml-tests`, and run the stable benchmark set (`[benchmark]~[manual]`) by default.

For deterministic CI regression checks, use the dedicated performance profiles:

```bash
python3 scripts/dev/run-performance-profile.py --profile cpu-linux --binary build/tests-perf/ofxGgml-tests
python3 scripts/dev/run-performance-profile.py --profile gpu-linux --binary build/tests-perf/ofxGgml-tests
```

The profile definitions live in `scripts/dev/performance-profiles.json`, and the checked-in baselines live under `.ci/performance-baselines/`.

**For detailed performance tuning, optimization strategies, and expected performance numbers, see `docs/PERFORMANCE.md`.**

## Source-grounded generation

`ofxGgmlInference` can now build source-aware prompts directly from URLs or an `ofxGgmlScriptSource` instance, so apps do not need to hand-roll HTML fetching and context assembly on top of the addon.

`ofxGgmlGuiExample` now exposes this through `Live context` policies:

- `Offline`
- `LoadedSourcesOnly`
- `LiveContext`
- `LiveContextStrictCitations`

These modes let you decide whether the assistant should stay fully local, rely only on explicitly loaded source URLs, or use broader live grounding such as loaded sources, domain providers, and generic search. The strict-citation mode keeps the same live lookup behavior but biases responses toward grounded source usage.

```cpp
ofxGgmlInference inference;
ofxGgmlPromptSourceSettings sourceSettings;
sourceSettings.maxSources = 3;
sourceSettings.maxCharsPerSource = 1800;
sourceSettings.maxTotalChars = 5000;

auto result = inference.generateWithUrls(
    modelPath,
    "Summarize the linked material and cite the supporting sources.",
    {
        "https://example.com/post-1",
        "https://example.com/post-2"
    },
    {},
    sourceSettings);
```

The helper normalizes HTML-heavy pages into cleaner text, clips oversized source bodies deterministically, and can ask the model to cite sources as `[Source N]`. For local folders, GitHub repos, or internet-backed script sources, use `generateWithScriptSource(...)` or `collectScriptSourceDocuments(...)`.

## Code Review Helpers

`ofxGgmlCodeReview` provides automated code review with hierarchical analysis, embedding-based ranking, and structured findings. It implements a multi-pass review workflow that examines individual files, then aggregates insights about architecture and integration.

### Quick Start

```cpp
#include "ofxGgmlAssistants.h"

ofxGgmlCodeReview reviewer;
reviewer.setInference(&inference);

// Set up workspace
ofxGgmlScriptSource workspace;
workspace.setLocalFolder("/path/to/project");

// Run review
auto review = reviewer.reviewRepository(
    workspace,
    "Focus on error handling and resource management"
);

cout << "Architecture Summary:\n" << review.architectureSummary << endl;
cout << "\nFindings:\n";
for (auto& finding : review.findings) {
    cout << "  [" << finding.severity << "] ";
    cout << finding.file << ":" << finding.line << "\n";
    cout << "  " << finding.issue << endl;
}
```

### Review Workflow

The review process works in multiple passes:

**1. File Ranking:**
```cpp
// Rank files by relevance and importance
auto rankedFiles = reviewer.rankFiles(
    workspace,
    "Security vulnerabilities"
);

for (auto& file : rankedFiles) {
    cout << file.path << " (score: " << file.relevanceScore << ")\n";
}
```

Ranking uses:
- Lightweight heuristics (file size, type, location)
- Embedding-based semantic relevance (when configured)
- Recency and modification frequency
- Project-specific importance patterns

**2. File-Level Analysis:**
```cpp
// Review individual file
auto fileReview = reviewer.reviewFile(
    "src/network/client.cpp",
    workspace,
    "Check for error handling and thread safety"
);

for (auto& finding : fileReview.findings) {
    cout << finding.category << ": " << finding.description << endl;
    cout << "  Severity: " << finding.severity << endl;
    cout << "  Confidence: " << finding.confidence << endl;
    cout << "  Suggestion: " << finding.suggestion << endl;
}
```

**3. Architecture Aggregation:**
```cpp
// Aggregate cross-file insights
auto archReview = reviewer.aggregateArchitecture(
    fileReviews,
    workspace
);

cout << "Design Patterns:\n" << archReview.patterns << endl;
cout << "Integration Issues:\n" << archReview.issues << endl;
cout << "Recommendations:\n" << archReview.recommendations << endl;
```

### Structured Findings

Review findings include detailed metadata:

```cpp
struct CodeReviewFinding {
    string file;
    int line;
    string category;        // "security", "performance", "maintainability"
    string severity;        // "critical", "high", "medium", "low"
    float confidence;       // 0.0 to 1.0
    string issue;           // Description
    string suggestion;      // Fix recommendation
    vector<string> relatedFiles;  // Cross-file context
};
```

### Review Focus Areas

Specify focused review criteria:

```cpp
// Security-focused review
auto securityReview = reviewer.reviewRepository(
    workspace,
    "Security audit: check for SQL injection, XSS, "
    "authentication bypass, and insecure data storage"
);

// Performance review
auto perfReview = reviewer.reviewRepository(
    workspace,
    "Performance: identify bottlenecks, memory leaks, "
    "inefficient algorithms, and unnecessary allocations"
);

// Code quality review
auto qualityReview = reviewer.reviewRepository(
    workspace,
    "Code quality: assess readability, maintainability, "
    "test coverage, and adherence to best practices"
);
```

### Repository-Specific Instructions

The reviewer automatically loads project instructions:

```cpp
// Reads from workspace:
// - .github/copilot-instructions.md
// - .github/instructions/*.instructions.md
// - AGENTS.md (nearest to workspace root)

auto review = reviewer.reviewRepository(workspace);
// Instructions are automatically incorporated into prompts
```

These files shape review behavior:
- Define project-specific standards
- Highlight important patterns to check
- Specify tools and frameworks in use
- Provide context about architecture decisions

### Review Modes

**Fast Review (Heuristic-based):**
```cpp
reviewer.setMode(ofxGgmlCodeReviewMode::Fast);
auto review = reviewer.reviewRepository(workspace);
// Uses lightweight heuristics, skips embeddings
```

**Deep Review (Embedding-enhanced):**
```cpp
reviewer.setMode(ofxGgmlCodeReviewMode::Deep);
auto review = reviewer.reviewRepository(workspace);
// Uses semantic ranking, more thorough analysis
```

**Incremental Review (Changed files only):**
```cpp
vector<string> changedFiles = {"src/main.cpp", "src/utils.cpp"};
auto review = reviewer.reviewChangedFiles(
    changedFiles,
    workspace,
    "Review recent changes for regressions"
);
```

### Integration with Scripting Workflow

The scripting assistant uses review insights:

```cpp
// The assistant path has been tightened to behave like an editing agent:
// - Prefers compiler-reported, allow-listed, and recently touched files
// - Weights recently touched files in symbol retrieval
// - Requests structured inspect→patch→verify plans
// - Performs recovery when model replies in weak prose
// - Carries forward failure context for remediation
```

**Compiler Context:**
```cpp
// When model produces weak output, recovery pass converts to structured tags
auto structured = reviewer.recoverStructuredOutput(weakProseReply);
```

**Workspace Retries:**
```cpp
// Retries carry forward context
ofxGgmlWorkspaceRetryContext context;
context.lastFailureReason = buildError;
context.touchedFiles = {"src/network.cpp"};
auto fixResult = reviewer.requestRemediation(context, workspace);
```

### When to Use

Use `ofxGgmlCodeReview` when you want:
- Automated repository analysis
- Multi-pass hierarchical review
- Semantic file ranking
- Structured review findings
- Integration with coding workflows
- Repository-aware review prompts

For complete examples and advanced features, see [docs/features/ASSISTANTS.md](docs/features/ASSISTANTS.md).

## Chat Assistant Helpers

`ofxGgmlChatAssistant` lifts the generic chat prompt path out of the `GuiExample`. It prepares reusable conversation prompts with optional system instructions and response-language hints, so apps can keep chat UIs thin and consistent.

Use it when an app wants local chat behavior without duplicating prompt assembly or keeping a second language-preset list in UI code.

## Code Assistant Helpers

`ofxGgmlCodeAssistant` provides Copilot-style local coding assistance with semantic search, inline completions, and intelligent code generation. It builds coding prompts with language presets, project memory, repo/file context, focused-file snippets, semantic symbol retrieval, and reusable actions.

Tool proposals can now be constrained with policy profiles (`balanced`, `read-only`, `workspace-safe`, `strict`) so hosted flows can keep planning, editing, verification, and web-grounding behavior aligned with the active mode.

### Quick Start

```cpp
#include "ofxGgmlAssistants.h"

ofxGgmlCodeAssistant codeAssistant;
codeAssistant.setInference(&inference);

// Set up workspace
ofxGgmlScriptSource workspace;
workspace.setLocalFolder("/path/to/project");
codeAssistant.setWorkspace(&workspace);

// Generate code with context
auto result = codeAssistant.generateCode(
    "Add error handling to the parseConfig function",
    workspace,
    settings
);

if (result.success) {
    cout << "Plan:\n" << result.plan << endl;
    cout << "\nCode:\n" << result.code << endl;
}
```

### Core Actions

**Code Generation:**
- `Generate` - Create new code from requirements
- `Edit` - Modify existing code
- `Refactor` - Restructure code while preserving behavior
- `FixBuild` - Fix compilation errors
- `ContinueTask` - Resume interrupted work
- `ContinueCutoff` - Continue when response was truncated

**Code Understanding:**
- `Review` - Analyze code quality and issues
- `GroundedDocs` - Generate documentation from code
- `findSymbols()` - Semantic search for definitions
- `buildCodeMap()` - Create a semantic overview

### Inline Completion

```cpp
string beforeCursor = "void setup() {\n    ofSetWindowTitle(";
string afterCursor = ");\n}";

auto completion = codeAssistant.prepareInlineCompletion(
    beforeCursor,
    afterCursor,
    "ofApp.cpp",
    workspace
);

// Use completion.text at cursor position
```

### Semantic Symbol Search

```cpp
// Find function definitions and callers
auto symbols = codeAssistant.findSymbols(
    "runInference",
    workspace,
    5  // max results
);

for (auto& symbol : symbols) {
    cout << symbol.filePath << ":" << symbol.line << endl;
    cout << symbol.context << endl;
}
```

### Structured Output

The assistant can return structured, machine-readable plans:

```cpp
auto structured = codeAssistant.generateWithStructure(
    "Add input validation",
    workspace,
    settings
);

// Access structured components
cout << "Acceptance criteria:\n";
for (auto& criterion : structured.acceptanceCriteria) {
    cout << "- " << criterion << endl;
}

cout << "\nFiles to modify:\n";
for (auto& file : structured.fileIntents) {
    cout << "- " << file.path << ": " << file.intent << endl;
}

// Apply unified diffs
if (!structured.unifiedDiff.empty()) {
    // See Workspace Assistant section
}
```

Structured responses include acceptance criteria, file intents, patch operations, unified diffs, test ideas, verification commands, review findings with severity/confidence, risk scoring, and build-error context.

### Advanced Features

**Compile Database Integration:**

When a workspace has `compile_commands.json`, the assistant upgrades retrieval with:
- Compile-database-aware file coverage
- Range-based caller tracking
- More accurate symbol resolution

**Planning Tools:**

```cpp
// Create semantic code map for planning
auto codeMap = codeAssistant.buildCodeMap(workspace);

// Turn specification into implementation plan
auto plan = codeAssistant.runSpecToCode(
    "Add user authentication with JWT tokens",
    workspace,
    settings
);
```

### Agent Runtime

For app-side orchestration, the code assistant exposes a session-based runtime:

```cpp
// Create a coding session
ofxGgmlCodeAssistantSession session;
session.mode = ofxGgmlCodingAgentMode::Build;
session.backend = "llama-server";

// Set approval callback for risky operations
auto approvalCallback = [](const string& tool, const string& details) {
    cout << "Approve " << tool << "?\n" << details << endl;
    return getUserApproval();  // Your UI logic
};

// Run with streaming events
codeAssistant.runWithSession(
    "Add error handling to network code",
    workspace,
    session,
    approvalCallback,
    [](const ofxGgmlCodeAssistantEvent& event) {
        switch (event.phase) {
            case ofxGgmlCodeAssistantPhase::PromptPrepared:
                cout << "Analyzing code..." << endl;
                break;
            case ofxGgmlCodeAssistantPhase::StructuredResultReady:
                cout << "Generated plan" << endl;
                break;
            case ofxGgmlCodeAssistantPhase::ToolProposed:
                cout << "Requesting approval for: " << event.toolName << endl;
                break;
            case ofxGgmlCodeAssistantPhase::Completed:
                cout << "Task complete" << endl;
                break;
        }
    }
);
```

**Session State:**
- `ofxGgmlCodeAssistantSession` tracks active mode, backend, touched files, last failure, and recent history

## Workspace Assistant Helpers

`ofxGgmlWorkspaceAssistant` extends the Code Assistant with safe workspace execution. It validates patches, applies unified diffs, manages transactions with rollback, runs verification commands, and implements a full "plan → edit → verify → retry" loop.

When paired with `ofxGgmlCodingAgent`, the default build-mode policy is now `workspace-safe`, while plan-mode auto-downgrades to a read-only tool policy so risky execution paths stay blocked unless explicitly re-enabled.

### Quick Start

```cpp
#include "ofxGgmlAssistants.h"

ofxGgmlWorkspaceAssistant wsAssistant;
wsAssistant.setCodeAssistant(&codeAssistant);

// Validate before applying
auto validation = wsAssistant.validatePatch(
    structuredPatch,
    "/path/to/project"
);

if (validation.safe) {
    auto result = wsAssistant.applyPatch(structuredPatch, workspace);
    cout << "Modified " << result.touchedFiles.size() << " files\n";
}
```

### Apply Unified Diffs

```cpp
string diff = R"(
--- src/main.cpp
+++ src/main.cpp
@@ -10,7 +10,9 @@
 void setup() {
-    loadConfig("config.json");
+    if (!loadConfig("config.json")) {
+        ofLogError() << "Failed to load config";
+        return;
+    }
 }
)";

auto result = wsAssistant.applyUnifiedDiff(diff, "/project/root");

if (result.success) {
    cout << "Applied successfully\n";
    cout << "Files modified:\n";
    for (auto& file : result.touchedFiles) {
        cout << "  - " << file << endl;
    }
} else {
    cout << "Failed: " << result.error << endl;
}
```

### Transaction Rollback

```cpp
// Begin transaction - saves current state
auto transaction = wsAssistant.beginTransaction(workspace);

// Apply changes
auto result = wsAssistant.applyPatch(patch, workspace);

if (!result.success) {
    // Rollback on failure
    wsAssistant.rollbackTransaction(transaction);
    cout << "Changes reverted" << endl;
} else {
    // Commit if successful
    wsAssistant.commitTransaction(transaction);
}
```

### Verification Loop

The workspace assistant can automatically verify changes and request fixes:

```cpp
// Apply patch
auto applyResult = wsAssistant.applyPatch(patch, workspace);

// Auto-select and run verification commands
auto verifyResult = wsAssistant.verify(
    applyResult.touchedFiles,
    workspace
);

for (auto& cmd : verifyResult.commands) {
    cout << "Running: " << cmd.command << endl;

    if (!cmd.success) {
        cout << "Verification failed:\n" << cmd.output << endl;

        // Request remediation plan
        auto fixResult = wsAssistant.requestRemediation(
            applyResult.touchedFiles,
            cmd.output,  // Failure context
            workspace
        );
    }
}
```

### Shadow Workspace

Run edits in a temporary shadow workspace before applying to the real one:

```cpp
// Create shadow workspace
auto shadowPath = wsAssistant.createShadowWorkspace(workspace);

// Apply changes to shadow
auto testResult = wsAssistant.applyPatch(patch, shadowPath);

// Verify in shadow
auto verifyResult = wsAssistant.verify(testResult.touchedFiles, shadowPath);

if (verifyResult.allPassed) {
    // Sync back to real workspace
    wsAssistant.syncFromShadow(shadowPath, workspace);
    cout << "Changes verified and applied" << endl;
} else {
    cout << "Verification failed in shadow workspace" << endl;
    wsAssistant.cleanupShadow(shadowPath);
}
```

### Safety Features

**Pre-Apply Validation:**
```cpp
auto validation = wsAssistant.validatePatch(patch, workspace);

if (!validation.safe) {
    cout << "Safety issues detected:\n";
    for (auto& issue : validation.issues) {
        cout << "  - " << issue << endl;
    }
    // Issues might include:
    // - Attempting to modify files outside workspace
    // - Creating dangerous file paths
    // - Operations not in the allow-list
}
```

**Allow-List Enforcement:**
```cpp
// Only permit specific operations
wsAssistant.setAllowedOperations({
    "create_file",
    "modify_file",
    "delete_file"  // Explicitly allow deletion
});

// This will be rejected if not in allow-list
auto result = wsAssistant.applyPatch(patchWithDangerousOps, workspace);
```

**Hunk Matching:**

The assistant validates unified diff hunks before applying:
- Ensures context lines match exactly
- Detects if files have been modified since diff generation
- Provides clear error messages for failed hunks

### Result Types

Access detailed results for inspection and logging:

```cpp
// Patch validation results
ofxGgmlWorkspacePatchValidationResult validation;
validation.safe;           // bool
validation.issues;         // vector<string>

// Apply results
ofxGgmlWorkspaceApplyResult applyResult;
applyResult.success;       // bool
applyResult.touchedFiles;  // vector<string>
applyResult.error;         // string
applyResult.details;       // string

// Verification results
ofxGgmlWorkspaceVerificationResult verifyResult;
verifyResult.allPassed;    // bool
verifyResult.commands;     // vector<CommandResult>

// Full coding loop result
ofxGgmlWorkspaceResult workspaceResult;
workspaceResult.success;          // bool
workspaceResult.attempts;         // int
workspaceResult.finalTouchedFiles; // vector<string>
workspaceResult.buildOutput;      // string
workspaceResult.testOutput;       // string
```

### Complete Coding Loop

Execute a full plan-edit-verify-retry cycle:

```cpp
ofxGgmlWorkspaceRequest request;
request.task = "Add retry logic to network requests";
request.workspace = &workspace;
request.maxRetries = 3;
request.verifyAfterApply = true;

auto result = wsAssistant.executeWorkflow(request);

cout << "Completed in " << result.attempts << " attempts\n";
cout << "Files modified:\n";
for (auto& file : result.finalTouchedFiles) {
    cout << "  - " << file << endl;
}

if (result.buildOutput) {
    cout << "Build output:\n" << result.buildOutput << endl;
}
```

### When to Use

Use `ofxGgmlWorkspaceAssistant` when you want:
- Safe code modifications with validation
- Transaction support with rollback
- Automated verification and retry loops
- Shadow workspace testing
- Production-ready coding workflows
- Full "AI pair programmer" experience

For complete examples and API details, see [docs/features/ASSISTANTS.md](docs/features/ASSISTANTS.md).

## Text Assistant Helpers

`ofxGgmlTextAssistant` lifts translation and general text-workflow prompting out of the `GuiExample`. It prepares reusable prompts for `Summarize`, `KeyPoints`, `TlDr`, `Rewrite`, `Expand`, `Translate`, `DetectLanguage`, and `Custom` tasks.

On top of those core prompts, the GUI example now includes professional one-click flows for executive briefs, action extraction, meeting notes, email replies, release notes, commit messages, natural vs. literal translations, and structured JSON replies.

Use it when an app wants translation or writing-assistant features without hardcoding task prompts in its UI layer.

## Speech Helpers

`ofxGgmlSpeechInference` adds addon-level speech-to-text support through a pluggable backend interface. The default backend targets upstream `whisper.cpp`, prefers a local `whisper-cli` build in `libs/whisper/bin` or `build/whisper.cpp-build/bin` when available, and ships with ready-to-use profile hints for common Whisper model families such as `Tiny.en`, `Base.en`, `Small`, and `Large-v3 Turbo`.

Use it when an app wants local `Transcribe` / `Translate` audio workflows without hardcoding command-line assembly in its UI layer. The `GuiExample` exposes executable path, model path, profile selection, language hint, prompt, and transcript output as a first-class panel.

The speech path can now also target an optional OpenAI-compatible speech server through `Server URL` and `Server model` in the GUI. When a speech server is configured, the Speech panel prefers the warm server backend first and falls back to `whisper-cli` automatically if the server request fails and a local CLI path is still available.

For a local `whisper.cpp` speech workflow on Windows, use:

```powershell
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\scripts\build-whisper-server.ps1
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\scripts\build-whisper-server.ps1 -Cuda
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\scripts\start-whisper-server.ps1
```

Or use the matching batch wrappers:

```bat
scripts\build-whisper-server.bat
scripts\build-whisper-server.bat -Cuda
scripts\start-whisper-server.bat
```

`scripts/build-whisper-server.ps1` now builds and installs both `whisper-cli.exe` and `whisper-server.exe` into `libs/whisper/bin`, so the CLI fallback and the warm speech server come from the same local `whisper.cpp` checkout. The helper defaults to `http://127.0.0.1:8081`, which avoids colliding with the addon's default `llama-server` text backend on `8080`. The GUI now defaults the Speech server URL to that local endpoint, auto-detects the local `whisper-cli` / `whisper-server` runtime, and can auto-start a local `whisper-server` during setup when the configured URL points at localhost and a local server binary is available.

When the backend supports it, the speech path now keeps richer artifacts:

- detected language hints from Whisper output
- `.srt` / `.vtt` subtitle artifacts when timestamp mode is enabled
- parsed timestamp segments surfaced back into the GUI through the same lightweight SRT parser style already used in `ofxVlc4`
- temporary microphone capture to WAV, so the Speech panel can record and immediately transcribe or translate from the default input device

The Speech panel now supports a simple microphone workflow directly in the GUI:

- `Start Mic Recording` captures from the default input device
- `Stop + Run` writes a temporary WAV and runs the current speech task immediately
- `Use Last Recording` lets you retry the same captured audio after changing prompt, language hint, or `Transcribe` / `Translate` task settings

## TTS Helpers

`ofxGgmlTtsInference` adds a parallel addon-level text-to-speech layer for synthesis workflows that should stay separate from Whisper-style speech transcription. The current addon exposes two backend families:

- Piper for direct `.onnx` voice models with a matching `.onnx.json`
- `chatllm.cpp` for converted OuteTTS artifacts such as `.bin` / `.ggmm`

Use it when an app wants local speech generation without baking one TTS runtime into its UI layer. The bridge exposes `Synthesize`, `Clone Voice`, and `Continue Speech` task labels, and the GUI example now routes the selected TTS profile to the matching backend instead of pretending all TTS models are interchangeable.

### Piper

The first built-in TTS profile is now Piper. Leave `Executable` blank to auto-discover the addon-local launcher at `libs/piper/bin/piper.bat` first, then fall back to `piper` on `PATH`.

The maintained upstream Piper repository is now:

- `https://github.com/OHF-Voice/piper1-gpl`

The older `rhasspy/piper` repository is archived, so prefer the maintained `OHF-Voice` upstream for documentation and project status.

On Windows, you can install the local Piper runtime and a recommended starter voice with:

```powershell
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\scripts\install-piper.ps1
```

That helper creates a local Python-backed Piper runtime under `%LOCALAPPDATA%\ofxGgml\piper-runtime`, writes an addon-local launcher into `libs/piper/bin`, and downloads `en_US-lessac-medium` into `models/piper` by default.

You can also use the one-command Windows setup flow:

```bat
scripts\setup_windows.bat --with-piper --download-piper-voice
```

To fetch another Piper voice later:

```powershell
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\scripts\download-piper-voice.ps1 -VoiceName en_GB-alan-medium
```

### chatllm.cpp OuteTTS

`chatllm.cpp` remains available as a backend-specific TTS option for converted OuteTTS models. The GUI example treats `Executable` as an optional override: leave it blank to auto-discover `chatllm.cpp`, or point it at a specific runtime if you have one already. The preferred addon-local runtime path is still `libs/chatllm/bin/chatllm(.exe)`.

On Windows, you can populate that runtime path with:

```powershell
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\scripts\build-chatllm.ps1
```

That helper clones `foldl/chatllm.cpp`, builds the local runtime outside the addon tree under `%LOCALAPPDATA%\ofxGgml\chatllm-runtime`, then copies only the final executable and nearby DLLs into `libs/chatllm/bin`.

## Diffusion Helpers

`ofxGgmlDiffusionInference` stays intentionally thin at the native layer, but the public bridge now carries more of the creative workflow state that matters in apps.

The current bridge surface supports:

- image tasks such as `TextToImage`, `ImageToImage`, `InstructImage`, `Variation`, `Restyle`, `Inpaint`, and `Upscale`
- selection policies such as `KeepOrder`, `Rerank`, and `BestOnly`
- optional CLIP-oriented ranking inputs like `rankingPrompt` and normalized text/image embedding control
- richer generated-image metadata including `sourceIndex`, selected-best flags, score values, scorer labels, and score summaries

That design keeps `ofxStableDiffusion` standalone while giving `ofxGgmlClipInference` a clean seam for prompt-image reranking. When a runtime attaches both a diffusion backend and a CLIP backend, apps can generate batches, score them semantically, and keep either the original order or the best-scoring result without pulling low-level `ggml` or diffusion internals across addon boundaries.

The GUI example now goes one step further for local workflows: `ofxGgmlGuiExample/addons.make` includes `ofxStableDiffusion`, and the Diffusion panel auto-attaches a local `ofxStableDiffusion` engine when that addon is available in the same openFrameworks `addons` folder. It also exposes quicker handoff actions such as reusing the current Vision image as an init image, sending generated outputs back into Vision, and copying generated image paths straight into the CLIP panel for reranking.

## Vision Helpers

`ofxGgmlVisionInference` adds multimodal image-to-text support for `llama-server`-compatible endpoints. It prepares task-specific prompts for `Describe`, `OCR`, and `Ask`, handles local image encoding as data URLs, and includes curated profile hints for families such as `LFM2.5-VL`, `Qwen VL`, `GLM OCR`, and `Llama 3.2 Vision`.

The GUI example now recommends `LFM2.5-VL` first for general vision tasks, keeps `GLM-OCR` available for OCR-focused flows, and labels Meta `Llama 3.2 Vision` as EU-restricted because the official Hugging Face download is currently blocked from the European Union.

The default `LFM2.5-VL` profile now points at the exact upstream GGUF download URL for `LFM2.5-VL-1.6B-Q4_0.gguf`, so the Vision panel’s model action goes straight to the correct file instead of a broken guessed path.

The vision path is now more purpose-built too:

- better task-specific prompt defaults for scene description, OCR, and grounded image Q&A
- broader OpenAI-compatible response parsing for more server response shapes
- image labels are injected into multimodal payloads, which improves grounding when a request uses more than one image
- OCR requests now ask for higher-detail image handling when the server understands that hint

The GUI example’s Vision panel also includes one-click quick actions such as `Scene Describe`, `Screenshot Review`, and `Document OCR` so common workflows feel less like raw prompting.

Use it when an app wants OCR, screenshot understanding, document extraction, or image-grounded prompting without rebuilding OpenAI-style request payloads manually.

## Video Helpers

`ofxGgmlVideoInference` adds a backend-driven video layer on top of the vision stack. The default backend samples frames and reuses the multimodal image path, while keeping the API open for future specialized backends such as dedicated video-language servers.

The sampled-frame workflow is now more structured:

- frame labels distinguish opening, middle, and closing samples
- prompts include sample count, clip-window hints, and clearer timestamp-aware instructions
- summaries and OCR requests are phrased to be more professional and to call out unsampled gaps when they may matter

The GUI example now exposes this path directly from the Vision panel with an optional video file input and configurable sampled-frame count, so you can route short local clips through the same stable `llama-server` vision profile.

The Vision panel now also includes dedicated `Action Analysis` and `Emotion Analysis` presets. Those tasks can still run through the regular sampled-frame vision path, but they can optionally target a stronger temporal sidecar service through `Sidecar URL` and `Sidecar model`.

### Temporal Sidecar Contract

For `Action` and `Emotion` video tasks, `ofxGgmlVideoInference` can call an optional sidecar endpoint. By default it normalizes the configured URL to `http://127.0.0.1:8090/analyze`.

The addon sends a JSON payload shaped like:

```json
{
  "task": "Action",
  "model": "temporal-action-v1",
  "video_path": "clip.mp4",
  "prompt": "...",
  "system_prompt": "...",
  "response_language": "en",
  "max_tokens": 512,
  "temperature": 0.2,
  "sampled_frames": [
    {
      "path": "frame0.png",
      "label": "Opening frame at 0:00",
      "timestamp_seconds": 0.0
    }
  ],
  "output_schema": {
    "primary_label": "string",
    "confidence": "number_0_to_1",
    "secondary_labels": "string[]",
    "timeline": "string[]",
    "evidence": "string[]",
    "valence": "string_optional",
    "arousal": "string_optional",
    "notes": "string_optional"
  }
}
```

The sidecar can respond either with those fields at the top level or under a top-level `result` object. The addon maps that into a professional report with:

- primary label and confidence
- secondary labels
- evidence bullets
- timeline bullets
- optional `valence` / `arousal` for emotion-style models
- optional free-form notes

Use it when an app wants practical local video understanding today, but still wants a clean path to stronger temporal backends later.

## Video Planning Helpers

`ofxGgmlVideoPlanner` adds a higher-level planning layer on top of text, vision, and video analysis. It can build single-scene beat plans, multi-scene generation plans, and AI-assisted editing briefs from a plain-language goal.

The planner currently supports:

- beat-oriented prompt planning for one clip
- recurring entities and scene continuity across multi-scene plans
- selected-scene versus full-sequence prompt assembly
- AI-assisted edit-plan generation with structured actions, durations, and editorial notes
- editor-workflow generation that turns edit plans into actionable next steps and direct handoff prompts for Vision, Write, Diffusion, Custom, and Montage flows
- lightweight workflow-state support in the GUI example, including active-step focus, done/undone tracking, and session restore for longer editing passes
- editor presets in the GUI example for `Trailer`, `Montage`, `Recap`, `Music Video`, `Social Short`, and `Product Teaser`, so common edit goals can prefill clip count, target duration, and grounding strategy in one click

The GUI example exposes that planner directly in the Vision / Video area with:

- `Plan Video` for beat planning
- `Plan Multi-Scene` for scene scripts and continuity-aware prompts
- `Plan Edit` for AI-assisted editing briefs
- handoff actions into Write and Diffusion for scene-level reuse

Use it when an app wants an LLM to structure video generation or editing before handing work off to a diffusion backend, a multimodal model, or a human editor.

## Companion Montage Helpers

`ofxGgmlMontagePlanner` is a companion/example-tier helper. Include `ofxGgmlCompanionWorkflows.h` or define `OFXGGML_ENABLE_COMPANION_WORKFLOWS=1` before including `ofxGgmlEasy.h` when a project intentionally opts into subtitle or transcript montage planning. It can parse SRT-style cues, score them against a montage goal, keep the result in timeline order, and export a CMX-style EDL alongside a human-readable editor brief.

The planner supports:
- **Drop-frame timecode** for NTSC 29.97fps workflows
- **Audio track export** for combined video/audio EDL files
- **Source file path references** for media management
- **Transition metadata** including duration and suggestions
- **Custom audio track routing** per clip

For detailed EDL export documentation, see `docs/EDL_EXPORT.md`.

The GUI example includes a `Subtitle montage automat` workflow with:

- local `.srt` selection or reuse of speech-generated subtitle output
- montage-goal scoring
- ranked clip suggestions
- inline editor brief preview
- `Copy EDL` for timeline handoff
- `Export active SRT` / `Export active VTT` for subtitle-slave handoff into `ofxVlc4`
- optional direct `ofxVlc4` preview when the example is regenerated with the companion addon available

Use it when an app wants transcript-driven rough-cut planning without building a full NLE integration first.

## Image Search Helpers

`ofxGgmlImageSearch` provides a lightweight provider-agnostic interface for internet image search. The addon currently ships with a working Wikimedia Commons backend, and the example uses it for prompt-driven reference gathering in both Vision and Diffusion workflows.

The GUI example can:

- search for internet reference images from a prompt
- reuse the current Vision or Diffusion prompt as the search query
- preview a selected result
- cache a chosen result locally for Vision image analysis or Diffusion init-image reuse

Use it when an app wants lightweight reference gathering without hardwiring a specific commercial image-search API into the rest of the workflow.

## Web Crawler Helpers

`ofxGgmlWebCrawler` provides a lightweight optional bridge for website ingestion. The default backend wraps the external `Mojo` CLI crawler, runs a local crawl, and normalizes discovered Markdown files into structured addon result objects.

On Windows, the recommended local setup is the bundled installer script:

`scripts/install-mojo.ps1`

That script installs Mojo into a local WSL-backed environment under `%LOCALAPPDATA%\ofxGgml\mojo\project` and creates a small Windows launcher at `libs/mojo/bin/mojo.bat`, which the crawler discovers automatically without leaving the full WSL venv inside the addon tree.

The default `Mojo` adapter currently supports:

- start URL
- crawl depth
- optional JavaScript rendering
- explicit output directory or temporary crawl directories
- normalized command output and discovered Markdown documents
- canonical source URL recovery from markdown metadata/frontmatter when available, with fallback to the crawl start URL
- `allowedDomains` enforcement on the requested start URL plus post-crawl filtering of normalized documents

Use it when an app wants to turn a website into local Markdown/documents for later embedding, retrieval, citation scraping, or RAG-style prompt grounding without coupling the addon to one crawler implementation.

## Versioning

Version macros live in `src/core/ofxGgmlVersion.h`. Runtime-facing version metadata is available through `ofxGgml::getAddonVersionInfo()`.

## Eval Coverage

The addon test suite now includes assistant-focused eval coverage for:

- symbol-aware retrieval quality
- symbol-aware caller/definition context building
- inline completion prompt assembly
- compiler-output parsing for fix-build flows
- compile-database-aware semantic indexing
- structured code-task parsing
- unified diff generation
- workspace dry-run safety
- workspace allow-list enforcement
- patch validation and transaction rollback behavior
- unified-diff hunk validation and apply behavior
- automatic verification command selection from changed files
- verification retry loops

That keeps the scripting assistant features regression-tested as first-class addon APIs instead of GUI-only behavior.
